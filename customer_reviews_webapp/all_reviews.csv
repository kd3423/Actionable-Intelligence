4	Must buy!	Genuine productSound & bass is excellent.The sound quality is depends up on the type of device that we used.Overall very satisfied with the product.Thank you Flipkart	0
5	Terrific	good product and Flipkart headphone or deep bass song,thanks	0
6	Very Good	Great value for money product...Using it since 2 months... No issues till nowSound quality from earphones not great bt good for its price. Voice quality through mic is excellent(superb noise cancellation)Great buy. :)	0
7	Great product	Value for money. Good move by Flipkart. Much appreciated.	0
8	Delightful	For this budget, I say this a good bass based headphone... Gives decent feedback. But u may need to have bass boosters in your mobile to enjoy the bass from normal downloaded songs. The biggest concern is that the white fibre gets dirty very quickly, would have to put it in washer, but not sure if it will work after that..Pretty weirdly, the earplugs doesn't fit properly, either they are small or big, or the ones which fit, come out automatically after sometime of use...	0
9	Very Good	Good quality product at this price	0
10	Did not meet expectations	Absolute liars!!If you're buying these considering the 2 year warranty forget it cause they are useless as my earphones stopped working in under 3 months and they just give us useless advice and no real solution.just go and kill yourselves flipkart I feel sorry I trusted you guys..	0
11	Could be better	The cables when touch each other makes noise interruption, which is irritating. You need to keep them seperate.	0
12	Does the job	Pros:1. Good sound Quality, its heavier in the Bass. Volume level is loud enough in crowded train travelling. This is due some good sound isolation rubbers.2. Good Built - Cable are Braided, makes it tough for rough use.3. Value for Money. The product reads 2 years of Warranty - not sure tough what exactly is covered.Cons:1. The earpieces are tiny, so if you have big ears you will find the earpiece to be just being inside your ear canal. (Note I am talk about the earpiece and not Ear Buds.)The biggest Ear Bud is bigger than the Actual Ear Piece(body). You can imagine how tiny the Body of the Earpiece is. It is sometime difficult to use, specially in big hands.2. The Mic is located on the Y joint  of the Cables. The Y joint is Exactly 14 inches away from the Earpieces.. thats way below you can take calls properly.3. No Clip - since the mic is on the Y clip which is Way below than normal. It think a Clip could have Saved the problem.The small Box comes with a manual, warranty card, earphones, 3 different sizes of plugs, a carrying case.Overall for 499. I think its worth for a daily use. But if you are music freak and have plenty of phone calls to attend without the handset, there are better options available.	0
13	Absolute rubbish!	Bakwas, chines earphone ... Sound is so loud that it will hurt your ears. Don't waste your 500 on this. Better to go for branded earphone , you can get better for better than this.	0
14	Worst experience ever!	Microphone is not fixed well, its broken just like  that, with in two daysWorst productWe lost moneyDont sell the produt with this qualityNo starSorry	0
15	Classy product	Better Than Many Original Products Out There In Market .1. All those confusing reviews those are suggesting that "it has uncomfortable fit and it slips out " are completely deniable .It is superbly fit in ears and doesn't even slip out , its so light at 12g tht it is like air in ear .2. It is very effective for noise cancellation , and its metal finish is very smooth and effective .3. I have personally ordered 3 earphones back to back , and I am using gun metal colour which is fabulous and whatever the colour is sound is same .4. I compared it with Mi Earphones , Ubon , Philips , Samsung canal earphones and found it better .5. Its design is impressive too , kevlar cable gives it strength and also doesn't let sweat stick to it .6. I use it in gym , running and cycling , which is very hardcore use and I am the earphone person , and if I have loved it after using numerous other earphones in market so you'll love it too .Pros :Ergonomic DesignStrong CableVery LightEasy Fit in earCons : (which is not really a con )Mic is lil far away , which you can manage , not a big deal .Completely Loved It . Awesome Product .	0
