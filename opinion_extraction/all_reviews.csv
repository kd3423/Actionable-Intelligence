2	Did not meet expectations	I have "ORDERED"  the steel series SIBERIA P100 with a non refundable option (a big mistake) .  As far as the problem is concerned, the Headset mic is picking so much noise though i am in the room, now this you can call as a issue isn't it? Also i have compared this product with same i.e. owned by one of my friend, he do have the same issue (actually more than that).I think this is a manufacturing default. Now no one from the Flipkart is listening to this concern. Happy shopping with Flipkart #unfair	0
3	Value-for-money	Awesome headset in this range. If ur budget is under 2k u should go for this..    	0
4	Highly recommended	The sound quality is pretty Impressive!!I am a Gamer, so I usually listens to the footsteps of the enemy team in Rainbow Six Siege.. It's Perfect for this price range  	0
5	Steelseries brand that builds Expensive Gaming peripherals.	Warning! putting this on and gaming for a while makes you forget that its even on your head, resulting in you damaging its wired connection. Short Story:not so loud but clear sound, good Built Quality and Above all Light as a feather.	0
6	Awesome	A number of features immediately stand out with this headset. The microphone is built into a kind of pimple on the left side of the headset. Because of this, the microphone is perfectly concealed,Furthermore, the gray headset looks fine. No crazy lights or colors. This means you have to immediately think of the PlayStation when you see the headset.The Siberia P100 can easily be connected to your controller. It is not a USB headset and there is a regular 3.5 mm cable. If you also want to use the headset for your phone, you can easily connect with it and enjoy your music.A handy extra is the mute button that sits smartly on the outside of the left speaker. When you have to mute quickly, you simply push your ear and your microphone is muted. Instead of an extra connector in your cord, there is an easy button on the headset. (Definitely a welcome feature)The headset is indeed a lightweight, which gives the P100 a piece of solidity, which still delivers good quality. The Siberia P100 costs very less and provides good quality that makes it bang for the buck.The headset is nice on your head.The sound quality of headset is extremely good. The range of the sound is fine. Both the low and high tones are fine. The P100 is a stereo headset but during shooters you do not notice that you miss extra dimension of 5.1 or 7.1. If you play these games at a higher level, keep that in mind. For a game like FIFA, the Siberia P100 is perfect.THE JUDGEMENTThe SteelSeries Siberia P100 should mainly have the price and the fact that it is easy to use in your PlayStation 4 controller. The appearance of the headset and the quality of the sound are more than fine. In addition, you can also hang the headset on your phone, making it a great option. If you are looking for a headset that is purely for gaming, then you better buy this headset Definitely recommended	0
7	Simply awesome	My first premium headsets and they didn't disappoint me at all	0
8	The best all rounder	It has mic It works with ps4 android/ios tab/phoneIts verry comforts on earSound realy good Worth money - spend money u want regret	0
9	Waste of money!	These Headphones doesn't have Proper Bass. For normal use it's fine but I won't recommend these for gaming. other problem with these headphones is the mic. it captures a lot of sound nearby which is irritating after a point. these headphones have a non-detachable aux wire plus there is no sound cancellation in these so that's a negative point too. the only good thing about these headphones is that they are very light weight and that's the plus point of it.	0
10	Expected a better product	Too much low sound on connecting to ps4 controller!!	0
11	Decent product	Sound quality is good but this product does not justify what it is labeled for. The packaging advertises "for PS4" but on console the volume is very very low even after maxing out the volume. When the same headphone is plugged into a computer or a phone with a powered amp, the volume is satisfactory. But I didn't purchased it for using it with my phone or my PC, I purchased it to use with my PS4 as advertised. But the output is not satisfactory.Pros:Good built quality.Very very comfortable. (Good for long gaming sessions)Good sound quality (for gaming)Short cable length is appreciated (personal choice as I plug them in to my Dualshock 4 so i don't need the extra wire length)Con:Very low volume when plugged in to Dualshock 4.	0
12	Sunday delivery	Thanks for sunday morning delivery, happy :)	0
13	Not recommended at all	If u want people to know what u are listening to... I'll recommend this product. I am returning the product coz I don't want people to know what m listening to.... Poor build quality... Did not expect this from steelseries.. Disappointment.. I would say people who have given good reviews about this product definitely don't have the sense of quality	0
14	Very Good	Build:This is entirely made of plastic but this is no way feels cheap. It is light and very comfortable to use. You can adjust the size. I can use it for Prolonged gaming session and also listening to the music via smartphone for an hour or so. Never felt any problem with it. Overall a well built product.Sound Output:This is a gaming headphone. If you are an audiophile then you may skip this one. But, for sound in gaming I've no complains. and I also use it to listed music via this one (provided your smartphone has 3.5 mm headphone jack). This is not base heavy. Base, Mid, High are very well balanced. You will get a good experience. I use this with my LG G6, MiA1 with Poweramp. And it  gives me a pleasant experience. ** For PS4 and Mobile it is simple Plug and Play. For PC it is not that difficult either. If you have an audio driver installed you will get an prompt when you will hook this on 3.5 mm jackConclusion:Got this on a deal on Flipkart at Rs: 1700 and it is a money well spent. If you get a deal on this buy it. You won't regret. SteelSeries is a company who are making gaming headphones for very long time. They are very famous all around this globe.	0
15	Waste of money!	Worst product	0
16	Must buy!

17	Horrible	audio quality is so poor	0
18	Very Good	Good gaming headset... at 1299/- it's worth, because the design is pretty cool and also sound, for counter strike & fps games, It's a nice option , for light music listeners can also enjoy music, but not for rock and bass music... bass is there but not to loud cause it's a gaming headphones... looks wise it's cool (I mean some guys are saying, (in reviews) that it looks cheap but it's not & performance wise it's comfortable (breathable cushions/ear pads) and have detailing in sound (footsteps, background voices/sound effects) it will work with your pc, laptop, mobile, and ps4 ... with 2 years warranty I hope it will long last.	0
19	Bad quality	Got the headset for 1299rs. Before buying this i was using Sony MDR-XB450 ,but i changed because the padding on the speakers started to come off so i thought to buy this brand and comparing i can say this steelseries is total garbage the sound quality is not that great, no bass. The build quality the plastic feels cheap material, Zero sound proofing. As for the buttons on the headset it works only when i plugged into my phone but on laptop it doesn't work. Really regret buying this.	0

25	Just okay	is not loud, doesn't hurt your ears which is a plus. built quality is not upto the mark. microphone is bad.	0
26	Waste of money!	The volume from the headphone is very low and top of that the headphones mute button is also not working i.e I am not able to mute the mic when ever I want to. it is continuously on. made a huge mistake by buying it that too also without a return option. Anyways, I have paid the price of my mistake. doesn't want anyone else to suffer the same, hence writing this review.	0
