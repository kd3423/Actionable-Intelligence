0	Good not excellent product as well seller/flipkart	I want to write about product and seller as well
  <br/>
  First about product : Product is good not excellent as it is exaggerated by apple Face ID is ok ok not as better as finger print ID (Touch ID ) it could be better if finger print unlocking also provided.Incase of performance its excellent. Disappointed with Siri ( it is unable recognise Indian accent as google asst does ),maps and Face ID
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now about seller : the date of delivery mentioned by seller/Flipkart is completely wrong the product hadnt been packed even the date of delivery (or just one day before the given date of delivery ) its been packed after raising complaint regarding the delay to the Flipkart. Then they(seller/Flipkart) changed date of delivery (postponed) and finally the product is received lately. However product is genuine.

0	Great service by Flipkart, high hopes from Apple X	So far so good. Have been using Android before this hence I found a few hiccups with the way Apple functions. It's a good phone and the face ID works well most of the time. "Most of the time" The no home bottom has changed the way this phone functions as compared to the past Apple phones. Kudos to Shreyas who delivered the phone to me right post the launch at around 6.40 pm. Commendable service by Flipkart. Thanks you.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  FaceID is definitely much better than touch ID. It gets faster and faster as it learns more from every unlock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Display is definitely the best I have used on an iPhone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notifications personal to a users eyes is also an amazing feature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery life has definitely improved as it can survive a whole day with a heavy user like me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Animojis are fun and the envy of my friends..haha
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, I m definitely impressed with this device.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I was able to preorder the 256 GB space grey. My decision to go with Space Grey was definitely right. Looks classy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only disappointment was with Flipkarts  Delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even after the preorder on 27th, Flipkart failed to deliver my phone on launch day because my shipment was travelling from one warehouse to another the whole day. This was frustrating.

0	Power house: iphone X, 256gb, space grey	I was desperately looking for this phone, since 3rd of November, I used to check flipkart everyday about 3-4 times a day and one lucky day at around 6 am in the morning I found one on flipkart. I wanted to buy a 64gb version in silver but at that time 256 gb was available in space grey, so I went ahead and ordered it at the very moment. I was at the right place at the right time, because after ordering it went back to out of stock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Talking about delivery, flipkart suggested that I would get the device 3-4 days later but got it the very next day at around 10:30AM.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Packing was okay, to be honest it was pretty mediocre. It was wrapped in standard flipkart plastic wrap and had 2-3 layers of bubble wrap on the phone box. Thats the least kind of protection for a product that costs a whopping 1.02Lakh INR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Talking about phone, you can never go wrong with apple. I have a 6s, 7 plus, galaxy s8 plus and now iphone x. Talking about iphone X, it has been one of the most controversial phones ever. The phone is a power house, performs everything smoothly. The notch is there but hardly affects me in my day to day life, oled screen is awesome. Take my word and if you have that kind of money to spend on, then surely go ahead with this phone(if you can find one).

0	"Top notch"!	Mind blowing! That's how I would describe my experience with the iPhone X.
  <br/>
  Those planning to shift from Android will come to know the beauty of software &amp; hardware integration.
  <br/>
  The phone functions seamlessly. It's battery can last 12-14 hours if graphics intensive games are avoided and the loudspeaker use kept to minimum.
  <br/>
  Currently there is a difference of 13K INR between 64GB &amp; 256GB models. I would definitely recommend the 264GB model as one can do limitless things with this phone.
  <br/>
  Cameras are superb. The display is "top notch"!
  <br/>
  You will almost never be bored using the phone. And of course, the face id works brilliantly. It's designed &amp; engineered to perfection.
  <br/>
  A strong piece of advice - Buy a good case and tempered glass for the phone.

0	iPhone X Show completely satisfied the fans	1. Excellent display and I never saw this kind of display quality in any other Mobiles. The display itself phone
  <br/>
  2. The FaceID functionality is nice and the way it deals with the notifications is excellent. Notifications will be shown only if  it identifies ur face. Apple didnt tell much about this in their demos. But this is an excellent feature.
  <br/>
  3.Battery backup is decent and it will be further improved with the future software updates.
  <br/>
  4. Excellent camera and sometimes u will get a feeling that the photos and videos taken from this camera will match the DSLR standards.
  <br/>
  5. I thought the top notch in the display will be a problem while viewing the content but in reality it was not the case and I didnt feel that while watching the videos as well. Very minimal
  <br/>
  6. Also I thought that screen will be much smaller but because of the full edge to edge display I never got that feeling and infact I am seeing more content on my display and which is excellent.
  <br/>
  7. I used SAMSUNG S8 for a while and its Display also awesome but after using this iPhone X I got a feeling that this display is much better.
  <br/>
  8. Thanks to the flipkart for delivering it on the launch day

0	Box office HIT	X loses its home button. Honestly, even the thought was life disruptive since I have been using the iPhones in the last decade. But it took me just 2 days to completely change that thought. The X made the 7+ feel primitive in a couple of days flat. I do NOT miss the previous generations anymore.
  <br/>
  If u are a large screen fan, you may still want to wait till Oct 2018 wherein Apple may release a bigger ver of X.
  <br/>
  The Phone is overall a HIT

0	Good not excellent product as well seller/flipkart	I want to write about product and seller as well
  <br/>
  First about product : Product is good not excellent as it is exaggerated by apple Face ID is ok ok not as better as finger print ID (Touch ID ) it could be better if finger print unlocking also provided.Incase of performance its excellent. Disappointed with Siri ( it is unable recognise Indian accent as google asst does ),maps and Face ID
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now about seller : the date of delivery mentioned by seller/Flipkart is completely wrong the product hadnt been packed even the date of delivery (or just one day before the given date of delivery ) its been packed after raising complaint regarding the delay to the Flipkart. Then they(seller/Flipkart) changed date of delivery (postponed) and finally the product is received lately. However product is genuine.

0	Great service by Flipkart, high hopes from Apple X	So far so good. Have been using Android before this hence I found a few hiccups with the way Apple functions. It's a good phone and the face ID works well most of the time. "Most of the time" The no home bottom has changed the way this phone functions as compared to the past Apple phones. Kudos to Shreyas who delivered the phone to me right post the launch at around 6.40 pm. Commendable service by Flipkart. Thanks you.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  FaceID is definitely much better than touch ID. It gets faster and faster as it learns more from every unlock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Display is definitely the best I have used on an iPhone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notifications personal to a users eyes is also an amazing feature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery life has definitely improved as it can survive a whole day with a heavy user like me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Animojis are fun and the envy of my friends..haha
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, I m definitely impressed with this device.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I was able to preorder the 256 GB space grey. My decision to go with Space Grey was definitely right. Looks classy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only disappointment was with Flipkarts  Delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even after the preorder on 27th, Flipkart failed to deliver my phone on launch day because my shipment was travelling from one warehouse to another the whole day. This was frustrating.

0	Power house: iphone X, 256gb, space grey	I was desperately looking for this phone, since 3rd of November, I used to check flipkart everyday about 3-4 times a day and one lucky day at around 6 am in the morning I found one on flipkart. I wanted to buy a 64gb version in silver but at that time 256 gb was available in space grey, so I went ahead and ordered it at the very moment. I was at the right place at the right time, because after ordering it went back to out of stock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Talking about delivery, flipkart suggested that I would get the device 3-4 days later but got it the very next day at around 10:30AM.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Packing was okay, to be honest it was pretty mediocre. It was wrapped in standard flipkart plastic wrap and had 2-3 layers of bubble wrap on the phone box. Thats the least kind of protection for a product that costs a whopping 1.02Lakh INR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Talking about phone, you can never go wrong with apple. I have a 6s, 7 plus, galaxy s8 plus and now iphone x. Talking about iphone X, it has been one of the most controversial phones ever. The phone is a power house, performs everything smoothly. The notch is there but hardly affects me in my day to day life, oled screen is awesome. Take my word and if you have that kind of money to spend on, then surely go ahead with this phone(if you can find one).

0	"Top notch"!	Mind blowing! That's how I would describe my experience with the iPhone X.
  <br/>
  Those planning to shift from Android will come to know the beauty of software &amp; hardware integration.
  <br/>
  The phone functions seamlessly. It's battery can last 12-14 hours if graphics intensive games are avoided and the loudspeaker use kept to minimum.
  <br/>
  Currently there is a difference of 13K INR between 64GB &amp; 256GB models. I would definitely recommend the 264GB model as one can do limitless things with this phone.
  <br/>
  Cameras are superb. The display is "top notch"!
  <br/>
  You will almost never be bored using the phone. And of course, the face id works brilliantly. It's designed &amp; engineered to perfection.
  <br/>
  A strong piece of advice - Buy a good case and tempered glass for the phone.

0	iPhone X Show completely satisfied the fans	1. Excellent display and I never saw this kind of display quality in any other Mobiles. The display itself phone
  <br/>
  2. The FaceID functionality is nice and the way it deals with the notifications is excellent. Notifications will be shown only if  it identifies ur face. Apple didnt tell much about this in their demos. But this is an excellent feature.
  <br/>
  3.Battery backup is decent and it will be further improved with the future software updates.
  <br/>
  4. Excellent camera and sometimes u will get a feeling that the photos and videos taken from this camera will match the DSLR standards.
  <br/>
  5. I thought the top notch in the display will be a problem while viewing the content but in reality it was not the case and I didnt feel that while watching the videos as well. Very minimal
  <br/>
  6. Also I thought that screen will be much smaller but because of the full edge to edge display I never got that feeling and infact I am seeing more content on my display and which is excellent.
  <br/>
  7. I used SAMSUNG S8 for a while and its Display also awesome but after using this iPhone X I got a feeling that this display is much better.
  <br/>
  8. Thanks to the flipkart for delivering it on the launch day

  Youll be blown away by the sound of speaker
  <br/>
  Photos sharpness and edges can be improved over software updates
  <br/>
  Slow mo video and 4K at 60fps is jaw dropping.
  <br/>
  *Pro tip - If you have the budget go for it you wont regret ;)

0	Box office HIT	X loses its home button. Honestly, even the thought was life disruptive since I have been using the iPhones in the last decade. But it took me just 2 days to completely change that thought. The X made the 7+ feel primitive in a couple of days flat. I do NOT miss the previous generations anymore.
  <br/>
  If u are a large screen fan, you may still want to wait till Oct 2018 wherein Apple may release a bigger ver of X.
  <br/>
  The Phone is overall a HIT
