0	Great buy	Product was used but still worked amazing. Used as a station alerting system in on did the busiest 911 systems in Colorado!	0
1	Very versatile and very fast transfer speed	Having the many ports and one dedicated to power makes it easy to charge a tablet and a phone while knocking out some of the cable clutter on the desk.The USB 3.0 ports are very fast for data transfer.  Huge improvement over a Belkin USB 2 hub it replaced.	0
2	works fine	The cable arrived on time and in great condition. It was ready to use and works just fine. I use it to play and charge my MP3 player.	0
3	Great for it's size and style	Being a sling, I was hesitant.  However, it is very nicely configured.  I LOVE the orange inside, which makes finding things very easy.  In the large main compartment I have the camera with lens, and extra lens, battery charger, and one or two other things; plenty of room.  In the top I keep an extra battery, lens cover/filter, SD cards and cases; and there is still plenty of room for keys, a wallet, and sunglasses.Extra things to note:  There is a strap on the side for a tripod...I keep a Pedco UltraPod II Lightweight Camera Tripod there.  There is also another thin stabilizing strap that hides under the bottom compartment of the bag.  I never thought I'd use it, but we went hiking recently and it really came in handy...it keeps the bag from moving around so much, which in turn keeps it more comfortable and helps a bit with weight distribution.  Overall it fits and feels fine, and is easy to get into without taking off.  At times it feels a little bulky, but I attribute it to all the nice thick protective padding.	0
4	Nexus 7 - a great return for what I paid.	"I bought it as a gift for my son.He is the perfect usage validation ""engineer"" :-)He is treating it roughly, physically and ""mentally"" (loading lots of stuff all the time).For months, the device is going some rough times, and so far so good!!!Also we are getting android updates on time.You can say I am very pleased with this buy."	0
5	Works great as all Cowboy Studio products do	Not sure what else to say about this product.  It works great, does what it says it will, and as always from the Cowboy Studio folks, it is just what I needed.	0
6	OK replacement for the original Canon battery	"I ordered another battery but was disappointed by the second one. It does not last as long as the first one. This means that there is poor and inconsistent quality control for these items. You can try your luck if you want!------ original review ------I have had this battery for nearly 3 months now. I purchased it after reading other reviews.Its a great value for money when compared to the OEM battery. It gives 2+ hours of back up with my Vixia HF200. I have run the battery until it is completely exhausted - even though the LED indicator said 25% remaining. When the battery is completely drained the camera simply shuts down with the usual message about not disconnecting the power source. There is no loss of data when the battery finally quits.Secondly, as I learnt from a fellow reviewer, the battery can be charged by using the camera-charger. No separate charger is required to be purchased.The only nuisance is the initial message about ""do you still want to use this battery"" because you might miss the action because of the delay. I keep the camera in stand-by (close the screen) in between shots to avoid the lag because of the message."	1
7	Very good basic mouse for the price	"This is a great basic, cordless mouse.  I plugged in the unobtrusive receiver and Windows 7 immediately recognized the device.  Although I played with some of the Logitech SetPoint options, the default Microsoft settings work perfectly for me.  Smooth, accurate action on any reasonably ""mouse-able"" surface - just don't expect it to work on glass.  This is a ""medium-to-large"" sized mouse.  The tallish profile results in less fatigue for me and the padded sides offer better control.  Forward/reverse buttons work well although, like other reviewers, I'd prefer that the scroll wheel had a smoother action.  I haven't had it long enough to have an opinion on battery life, but so far, so good.  For the price, a very good mouse."	0
8	Very Good Sound, Easy Setup, Great Design 6mos later not so good...	Very intelligently designed unit. Setup was very easy. I did not experience any interference with wireless router or access points (three are nearby). I especially liked the 3 available inputs (optical, miniplug and RCA) and the ability to select among them. This has allowed me to have a Roku Soundbridge and a Samsung TV plugged into the unit. Bass is very good without being overwhelming. Sound is clear and bright, better than the TV, but still not audiophile territory. Its a convenient, intelligently designed functional solution to the mediocre sound quality of a flat screen TV. The product reeks of high quality in its exterior design and ease of setup. The programmable IR remote of the unit was very easy to set up and use too.Update 6 mos later. The unit has become flaky in the extreme. It still works sorta. The remote control has died; tried new battery but no luck. Programmed unit to work with Samsung TV. It turns on but cannot control volume. It seems to lose its way every day. Need to unplug to reset the unit. I may toss this for another brand. Definitely unsatisfied.	1
9	Great Product!!	Great Product!!  It came as described and replaced a bad part and it works.  I would recommend it to others looking for a good replacement.	0
10	Sturdy and feels great to the touch!	I bought this product for two reasons: Kept my original keyboard sanitary, and aesthetic color to match my company colors. For $0.99 plus shipping I wasn't expecting much, but I was surprised. The synthetic material used has a rubber-like tactile feeling which  allows it to sit firmly in place on the keyboard and it aids in my typing ability. The color is 'dark' and in low light conditions seem to illuminate the keys making typing at night a more enjoyable experience.All in all, I recommend this product to anyone who likes to keep their electronic equipment pristine.	0
11	external memory for my SANDISK 4G MP3 Player	this was the perfect addition to my SANDISK 4gb MP3 player. I have 20GB of total space for under $60 - you can't beat it. Easy to place into the device. Came in record time. I would order from Kingston Digital again!	0
12	Good replacement for Time Warner	When Time Warner decided to start charging for cable modems, I bought this one to replace the rental. I currently have their 30/5 wideband service, and the Ubee modem/router they gave me for that was problematic. The router side of the Ubee kept having problems, with unreliable wireless connections and reporting as a strict NAT for my Xbox360, so I had already bought my own router and turned that part off. I was also regularly having to reboot the modem due for connection issues. I wasn't going to pay money for that service, so I bought this Surfboard based on its other reviews and returned the Ubee.I had some fits getting it recognized by Time Warner, but most of that was on their end. Took several calls and Tier 3 support to everything set up correctly. Since then the modem has been working just fine, giving me slightly better download speeds than the Ubee (Steam would hit peaks of 3.7 MB/s with this Surfboard vs 3.4 MB/s with the Ubee). Mostly it's been far more reliable, I've only had to reset the modem and my router once since I've had it. Very happy overall with the upgrade, mostly I now need to see if it holds out for the 2 years or so it will take to pay for itself.	0
13	"if you're torn between this and a ""matte"" screen, chose this."	went with a matte screen protector originally, dreadful regret. horrible rainbow effect across videos and games, and so much worse on web pages. tore it off and got this to replace it, and have been using it for several months since, without a single complaint. skip the matte hype, go for clear and what works. you didnt buy a tab with an HD screen just to have it polluted with a horrible screen protector. do right the first time.	0
14	Great Picture - Perfect size for mid size room	This TV screen size is perfect for a medium sized living area where a 32 would be too small and a 50 would be too large.  The picture is great with many choices for adjustment.  The sound is okay, better than the 32 we have but still lacks any bass notes.  This is somewhat disappointing when music playing in what you are watching is important.  I suggest external speakers - they don't need to be expensive ones if a full range of highs and lows are important to you. I give it a 4 because of the lack of low range sounds when music is playing.  The picture is great though.	1
15	Solved my media issue	This device enabled me to get over a particular hurdle with regard to transference of DVR'd material to disc, for permanence as well as portability, i.e., it has become an excellent 'middleman' between my DVR and PC. The VC500 is truly a terrific gadget!	0
16	Jarv NMotion Sports Wireless BT	I was suprised by how well this product works.  My only criticism is about the earbuds.  None of them fit me perfectly.  If it was secure in my ear, I could appreciate the noise-isolation feature more.  The ear hooks work well enough that it won't fall off.  This product works better when the wire is in front of you rather than behind the neck.	1
17	This thing is awesome	I love my Chromebook so far, as a college student It is a wonderful thing to have because its battery lasts for more than long enough for me to get through the day and then some. the keyboard has a nice feel as well as the touchpad gestures being so helpful. I would however caution new purchasers that this is not something i would recommend as getting instead of a standard pc, but if you already have one this is great because chrome remote desktop allows me to remote into my other pc to do anything i couldn't do on the chromebook	0
18	Great case	Used for ASUS A55VD-AH71 15.6-Inch Laptop, and it fits perfectly.  Protects laptop well and feels like it is sturdy,  I use this to actually put the laptop into another backpack and it works great.  Feels like there is more than adequate protection for it.	0
19	Surprising results	It took me all of 30 minutes to get used to this new shape.  It help my wrist feel much better.  By that night I was looking to make some modifications.  Nothing wrong with the product but I generally find that most mice don't fit my hand that well.  I have short finger I guess, and usually have to really extend my fingers to comfortably use any pointing device for any length of time.  What I did was to temporarily attach a piece of dense rubber (3/8&#34; thick foam matting) to the back end of the mouse.  This creates a kind of ledge on which I can rest my palm and hold my hand higher on the mouse.  The buttons feel kind of stiff, but may be because it is new, hopefully they will loosen up.  The stiffness of the mouse buttons is why I didn't give this product 5 stars	1
20	Works as it should	The cable works.  It's not steel.  I know a lot of reviewers made note of the fragility of the connectors, but if you use it carefully, it works.  No, you can't attach it to a flash bracket with a flash and swing it around like a baseball bat, but if you take care (as I do with all equipment) it operates as it should.  I prefer canon branded equipment whenever I can afford because it's typically better constructed and this is no different.	0
21	Does what it is supposed to do	Works well, price is high for what it is. Should be like $50 In my opinion.  Tap power button for brightness control. Hold power button to turn on and off.	0
22	Great little camera ...	This is the second IP camera I bought, the first one was a stationary D-Link model (poor video, no pan/tilt, no wireless).The FI8910W has proven to be very easy to setup and operate.I can imagine though that remove access and the almost required use of services like DynDNS can be confusing for the less experienced computer users.Plenty of apps out there for both iPhone, iPad (love FoscamPro by Logic Conculting LLC - $4.95 if I recall correctly) and Android that work great with the FI8910W.Note: QNAP NAS devices now seem to support the FI8910W - although I could not test this (not a Windows user, and QNAP Surveillance Station only works with Internet Exploder).A few things you might want to know;- video is only MJPEG 640x480,- pretty good picture quality- Infrared (night vision) is very reasonable for indoor use.- you first need to set everything up using a wired network connection- Remote access (ie. not at home) requires a service like DynDNS- Webinterface does the trick but is not exactly great- the camera's a bigger than expect (but that's OK)So far I love the set I bought to monitor my sick dog. Presets (positions; both pan and tilt) in the webinterface and the FoscamPro iPhone app work great.I can highly recommend the FI8910W camera's.Note: If Foscam releases a h264 model of the FI8910W then I most certainly will get those (better video compression - ie. less fast connection needed to get a reasonable image).Current Foscam h264 models all appear to be compared to the FI8910W, and most users complain that they like the FI8910W better.	0
23	Get the Panasonic Brand	battery is not very efficient at  holding charge.  disapates rapidly and is generally no a reliable backup battery.  Would not recommend.	1
24	great key that doesn take up too much room	The problem with my macbook pro is that when you put a usb key (most anyway) the usb port next to it is blocked.This one is supper thin and perfect.Ive been using it a lot and have found no issues.and it was the cheapest I had found (24 bucks for a 64gb)	0
25	Good for price	I owned another Olympus which was broken and needed to replace with a simular one.  Not as happy with this one.  Takes good pictures but does not have a good zoom.  Hopefully this one will not break as easily as my other one.	1
26	Excellent	Have been using it for several years, still works like a champ!  Garmin should make this the standard offering with their watches.	0
27	Great upgrade for a mid-2012 MacBook Pro	Added incredible amount of speed to my mid-2012 MacBook Pro. I am assuming that Apple installed 5400 rpm drives in their MacBook Pro line to help with battery life - I have experienced no change in battery performance with this new disk installed. Most importantly, it allows me to run Windows 7 in VMWare Fusion pretty fast. I used to dread firing up the Win7 VM for something work-related I can't do on the Mac, now it's like I have two computers in one.	0
28	WELL WORTH THE $$	Works Great for our 2008 Honda Odyssey EXL.  We have 3 kids and only 2 came with van.  5 Stars for a great product that is reasonably priced.  way better then paying 5X for the Honda version.  I will be buying again if we ever nee more.	0
29	False advertising	"7200mAh 9 Cells Replacement Dell Inspiron 1525 1526 series Laptop Battery fits RN873 GP952 M911 X284G series Laptops""""w/a AGPtek USB2.0 All In One Card Reader""""Got the battery not the card reader! Hey, at least I got the battery lol"	1
30	Lame get a roku or WD streaming box	Blows. Nothing like the TV comercial lag on a 1300mbps fast wireless is horrible.  get a roku or WD streaming box, they are more money but in this case cheaper is not better	1
31	Good speed and performance	Works well with my dslr. Have never been able to fill it. I guess 16gb would be enough for average use. Go for faster speeds and smaller size.	0
32	Works great!	"I was looking for a way to make my iPod play through a boombox or speakers.  This worked perfectly.  Just connect the dock to your iPod and the other end to a ""line in"" on whatever you want the sound to come out of, and it works great.  Sound quality is as good as you will get with a stereo plug."	0
33	worth it	Just wish the case had a keyboard option.  It is all you need for your tablet in one kit. Buy it.	0
34	It works, it doesn't work much better than another antena I had	I had to put it on a cookie sheet to get it to work.Add that to the cost of making this work and there you have it.	0
35	Awesome camera	It's awesome camera to use. Picture quality is good. I like this camera settings and even video also very nice.	0
36	Good price for good product	Very good price comparing with the manufature list price. Fast deliveryfrom the seller. Recommend for one with Magellan 1475T.	0
37	Very Easy To Use - Pretty Good Quality	I have only used this a few times so far, but the ease of use is great! This is not for recording HD images to show on a big screen, but to create decent quality videos you want to post online or make your own DVD movies.Just plug in the USB connection to your computer and the software, saved on the camera, is loaded and run.There are only two things that I'd love to see: a wider zoom range and a soft USB cable connection so the camera can rest on the desk while you have it hooked up. I would strongly recommend buying one so you don't risk damaging the camera while it is plugged in.	1
38	Perfect	Does what it says it does.  Works perfectly in my Xbox Slim and now I have the ability to add more games.	0
39	Seagate	I am very pleased with the Seagate external hard drive..The product arrived on time and was as described	0
40	tiny footprint, mega sound!	I kind of love this lil' guy!  Extremely portable and lightweight,  It sounds surprisingly loud and clear considering it's small size; i don't hear the tinniness i've heard in other generations of these types of small speakers.  construction appears to be sturdy.Setup was utterly simple.  I charged it (it was fully charged in an hour or so), and pairing took about 25 seconds.  brilliant!  I can't yet speak to it's battery life and will update the review if it sucks.I'm happy as a clam with this speaker!  I envision using it my bedroom, popping it into my bag and taking it to work, maybe even clipping it on and going on hike with it just because i can.  Buy one!	0
41	good camera.	Good camera for the price. I gave it 4 star because it doesn't have a spring on the battery door.	1
42	well built piece of equipment	this cable works as it should and seems to be well made. I have used it for several weeks now and have no complants.	0
43	Wrong item recieved... twice	I ordered the Philips HS500.  I received the Philips SHS5200, which is a MUCH cheaper headphone.  I notified Amazon that I received the wrong item.  They sent me a replacement which was another set of the SHS5200.  I called Amazon customer support and got a refund.  Don't order this item unless you want to pay twice as much as for a set of Philips SHS5200.	1
44	Wimpy battery, front LCD is unique but a hassle	This is probably a great camera for people who just need a point and shoot to take snapshots now and then, and the front-facing LCD is handy if you can deal with its quirks.But after having it a few months I'm just not that impressed. Here's what I don't like:- Wimpy battery - on my last outing it conked out after about 110 shots, none with flash, only a handful with both front and rear LCD on, and with the battery fully charged the night before.- The front LCD is a hassle to use; it always starts up in a mode where it only will automatically shoot when it detects a smile, and it's touch-sensitivity is pretty poor.- Macro mode (close-up) doesn't work very well, many shots end up out of focus.- The USB/charging cable is a proprietary cable, so that's one more cable to keep track of and maybe lose.On the upside, there are some pluses which could make up for the problems for a lot of folks:- If you must have a camera with a front LCD, this is one of the few out there. The front LCD will even show funny faces accompanied by silly noises to get kids to smile.- It's small and light.- The lens doesn't extend/retract, so it's less likely to get damaged.- It has a lot of scene modes.- It charges from USB.- The pictures look fine, but like most point-and-shoots, they are a tiny bit overexposed if you use auto mode.P.S. Before getting this camera I was quite happy with my Canon SD1200IS, but I really wanted a front LCD to take those occasional shots of me and my partner on vacation kind of stuff. Unfortunately, about the *only* thing this Samsung has over the Canon is the front LCD (and more megapixels, though that's not as important to me). In other respects I think the Canon's superior.	1
45	Excellent quality - AND, will fit if you have small inner ears!	"Seriously...these are the first buds I've ever been able to fit inside my ears - they stay put and don't fall out!  Very comfortable to wear, the foam padding helps drown out exterior noise so you can concentrate on the exceptional sound quality these ear buds produce.  The cable from the 1/8"" connector to the ""Y"" measures 36"", while the rest of the cable to each ear measures 16"" long. There is a tiny ""clothespin"" to keep it attached to your clothing.  I'm using this with an LG840G Tracfone, it works great.  Sound quality is excellent, the bass is deep, rich and not muddy, the treble is crisp and clean. Listening to music through these ear buds I'm hearing notes I never have heard prior to this on my expensive home stereo. In addition to a zippered storage case, there are extra ear tips in various sizes to fit most any size ear."	0
46	Fantastic Camera	I've always been interested in the Canon PowerShot, and I'm pleased that I got it. This camera is great for any photographer, with it's terrific zooming capabilities and it's editing abilities. If you have the likes ofNew 32gb Micro Sd Card Sdhc Tf Flash Memory Card 32gb Class 10, New! Usa!, the you should be set when it comes to memory. Aside from, I can't think of a better camera to have around then this Canon.	0
47	Much better than my old GPS.	We had a outdated Sony GPS unit which worked well, but no longer had the ability to be updated. This unit is great, easy to program, and we can get free updates forever.  We love it and may buy a second for our other car.  John	0
48	Seems like a good enclosure, but I couldn't use it	As far as I know this enclosure would work wonderfully - I just didn't have the right kind of laptop drive actually to use it.  For the uninitiated (as I was), this is for SATA drives ONLY.  The drive I was trying to use was ATA, so I needed a different product.	0
49	Easy to use and also records from antenna	Only draw back is when you have a power failure you must reboot. This takes time so I added a battery backup and that solves the problem.The wife has learned real fast on all the features it has and is on it each and every day.  She cannot live without it.	0
50	IT PROTECTS YOU BY KEEPING YOU AWAKE!!!	"This product re-defines the phrase ""CHEAPLY MADE"" It is also extremely sensitive (no sensitivity adjustment) rendering it, in my view, impracticable.  Any small vibration sets it off! Someone walking or talking a little too hard on the hallway, a car alarm, and forget about it if you like to crack a loud gaseous one while you're sleeping. The darn thing will wake you up in a panic as a reminder not to contaminate the air again. It also goes off when you touch it, like to turn it off or change the sound. I threw mine from the hotel window and felt good when i saw it break in many pieces, upon impacting the roof of the adjacent building. Then I was able to go to sleep happily uninterrupted."	1
51	What's not in the box	I love my new camera, and at such a great price!  It arrived very quickly, too.  Just so you know, this camera box does not come with a camera case or a memory card, and the camera only holds about 5 photos without a memory card.  It appears that memory cards START at $15.  The box does include a battery, battery charger, USB cable, AV cable, and hand strap, and some software.  The battery needs to be charged for 2 hours before use.	0
52	Great Camera for Price	If you're looking for an inexpensive camera and fully automated to take the guess work out of photography, then this might be the one for you. Takes clear and crisp photos, which sometimes in the past has been a problem for this novice photographer. I like the simplicity of it, terrific for the casual photographer who wants to take family or event shots to capture the moment. The price was right, no shipping charge and as an added plus, always no sales tax with Amazon. Doesn't get better than that in the retail market.	0
53	Great Sony Card.	I have had no issues with this card at all.  I recently got a new 16.2MP Sony Cybershot DSC-WX9.  I had no issues installing this card, and it holds a great deal of high quality and 3D pictures and video.  Surprisingly my HP card reader that is built into my computer accepts this and reads this card without any trouble.  Even if the computer didn't read the card I could just as easily use the USB cable to import the photos and video.I recommend this card if anyone thinks about buying it, but make sure your device supports Pro-HG Duo HX memory before placing the order.  From what I understand this card is not completely interchangeable with other Memory Stick types.	0
54	Quick and easy (Win7 and a small network)	My old D-Link print server died so I purchased this TrendNet (wired) print server based on reviews.Setup between my network, Win7 computer & Oki Microline 320 printer was quick and easy.  Up and running within 10 minutes.	0
55	Pricey but best quality	I was hesitant to purchase based on the price but I'm glad I did.  I'm pretty picky about my ride so quality is very important.  Had tried several different mounts for Beltronics and could never find one I felt was ideal.  And then there's the hassle with power cords.  Got the mount and the mirror tap for 07 Dodge Ram.  Right out of the box, could tell that quality was awesome.  If I had my own machine shop, this is how I would do it.  Fit is perfect, installation was easy and the end result is perfect placement and rock solid with no ugly exposed wires.	0
56	Stays on real good	Either a cover fits or not, stays secure or not. This one does exactly what it's supposed to. Very secure and protects well.	0
57	Nice Bright Blue Fan	Very very nice looking fan. I bought it for my new computer build with the Corsair Obsidian case and was going to put the fan in the front. Unfortunately, the fan was too thick to have it placed in the front because the hard drive bays were in the way. Instead I placed the fan on top of the case bringing cool air from above. So that is pretty much the only con about this fan, other than the noise. The fan is probably the loudest fan on my machine, which is okay for me but it depends on you. The fan is distributes cool air in to the machine, which is pretty obvious. If you're looking for a fan that is kind of noisy and want to have a cool look to your case, then this is the one. For more reviews, and unboxings, please visit my YouTube channel by placing this at the end of the YouTube url /darken731. Thanks!	1
58	Less than stellar	Bought this hoping to step up from my laptop built in camera. Can't say i'm happy with it.Positive:* Looks good* With good lighting and right software/config the picture is goodNegative:* Pain to install, software is clumsy and slow* Doesn't work with Mac* HD in Skype is fiddly and unreliable (yes, i know it's a hack, but still, it's one of the primary uses for any webcam, so...)* Couldn't get HD video to work in messenger either* Low light performance is better than my old webcam, but still not good (there is a definite lag in low light conditions)Bottom line: if you are looking for an HD webcam that you can just plug in and get on with it - look elswhere. If you are an IT guy with time to spare and likes the challenge - then this one is right up your alley.	1
59	Good Idea -- Flimsy quality.	Well First of all, if you buy a slim drive most likelly its because you plan to carry it around but the case of this drive is just too weak. if you hold it by the top to close the drive, the plastic is so weak it bends down preventing the drive from closing. The drive inside it was a Sony drive, but for some reason, it WONT read CDRW disks unless you use the external AC adapter (tried with several systems and all possible solutions found in forums including firmware updates). Now some good things: basically no problem to get it recognized by XP, Very quiet operation (considering other laptop drives i've heard). Conclusion: Not recomended unless you are a very very careful person and dont want to use it to write or read cds (DVDs work great)	1
60	This helped get rid of cable	I got this Roku as a surprise gift just as I was deciding to get rid of cable tv...that was the best decision I have made. I was able to set this up very quickly to recognize our wireless network. There are a ton of channels available and numerous private channels also available, I can access all major networks as well as Netflix and Amazon prime videos, I have never had any problems streaming anything thus far. I use this primarily to stream netflix and listen to pandora-- I have also added a number of the private channels e.g. NASA Tv which was a big draw for our 3 year old to watch the shuttle take off and see what was going on in space. There are a number of channels you can subscribe to for premium content, e.g. cable networks and HULU plus, I have not done any of those yet but based on what I see thus far it would be a huge bonus and still way cheaper than the 65 dollars I was spending on just basic cable.The Roku itself is very small, maybe 6x6, I do note that it always seems warm--I have yet to notice it getting extremely hot and it hides away very nicely next to the DVD player.  If you are contemplating getting one, I highly recommend. The online Roku site is pretty good but you will find your best information in other forums especially for private channels.	0
61	First Morning and Couldn't Be Happier	So I'm a huge Zune fan, and I have a lot of products made by them and I haven't had one go wrong yet.  So I wondered if there were any other products I could find to make life easier and go figure I found another product that doesn't disappoint.  I would go to iHOME to get this product because average shipping time is 1 to 2 months and nobody wants to wait that long.  iHOME will get it to you within a week at best.  I got the Zune Alarm Clock and here are my reasons why any Zune fan should get this product.--- Sleek, and stylish design / Different settings for brightness for a better undisturbed sleep.  Also multiple mounts for different Zunes.--- User Friendly / Button placement is easy to understand and use.--- Alarm Functions / 2 different alarm functions 2-5-7 days setting, Wake to Zune, Buzzer, or Radio.--- Sound Quality / For the alarm itself the volume starts at 0 and gradually goes up to make sure your able to hear it.  It's nice to not have to set your alarm volume and have the problem that it's to loud or soft.  The overall sound quality is just great I haven't had an alarm clock that was this good for sound.--- Remote accessory / I think it's a tad overkill for a alarm clock but it's nice hit snooze via remote.  Also for just listening, like with the stereo docking port with remote package.Notice:  I don't think it's a bad feature but to ensure your Zune plays the right music for your alarm, make a playlist called alarm or alarm clock, and make sure it's on that playlist or song before you you go to sleep so that suites your waking needs.I personally think this is a great product and a lot better than the CD Alarm clocks.  The reason why I say this is the ones I've had when the volume is to high the CD will skip or not play but if you're using an MP3 Player then there's nothing that'll skip or not read.  All in All this is a great product and I would deffinatly say buy it.	0
62	Just works	Works fine with my Nikon D5100. I don't use the wire on the outside to make use of the wireless remote receiver on the bottom. Have not had any problems with it. Have not used it terribly that much though. The Nikon batteries last longer than I expected. I buy them through theMilitary exchange website and their only $27.00 for the real Nikon ones. So I have not tried the fool the camera thing by putting a factory battery before a non one thing.	0
63	does what it's supposed to do.	This lens hood fits my 55mm mount Sony a55.  Works fine. looks cool. (which is important, in the world of amateur photography).  Confession time: I rarely find situations where I have glare situation that really needs a hood.  But you gotta have one of these if you wanna look pro, amiright?	0
64	I like it	It is reasonably heavy duty.  The design allows you to customize the inside to meet your particular needs.  Fairly heavy duty.	0
65	EXCELLENCE	im not sure what others say but this drive rocks in real world applications your benchmarks might not read 500up 500down but it definitely kicks some serious butt. ive tried multiple ssd and i would have to give this one the highest ranking in performance in real world applications games movie encoding boot up times 12 sec if you want faster get a highpoint 2720 sgl rocket raid card and raid 3 or more of these together and you will see performance unlike anything you can imagine, but boot up takes longer bout 10-12 sec longer but once your in nothing can slow your drives down. dont hesitate 100 bucks for 128 gb with 5 year warranty its a no brainer.	0
66	Works as Promised	Got this so that I could project from my Lenovo Yoga 13 laptop that only has HDMI out. Tested it, worked perfectly.	0
67	Fail	Fail.  This only worked for a short while and the sound quality was horrible.  Sound got static-y and then faded to nothing.  The retractable feature is nice, but that's about it....	1
68	Fantastic!	A must for all who would like to copy drives. No instructions needed. Very easy to use and convenient! Would recommend to all!	0
69	Perfect	I needed a USB extension cable for my printer since after loading WIN8 on my PC I was not able to use the network interface anymore.  I ordered this cable and it worked perfectly	0
70	Inconsistent Behavior	I thought my SD card in my camera was going bad because some of my pictures wouldn't transfer or would come out corrupted. Turns out it only happened when I used this particular adapter. Other adapters and transferring with a USB cable directly connected to the camera didn't exhibit the same behavior. It's nice and compact, but I don't use it because it's unreliable.	1
71	Great Cable at a GREAT Price	I have bought many of these and they are EXCEPTIONAL cables for the money.  I do not see the point in spending more for a cable then what you pay for these.  I have had zero problems.	0
72	ok,but	This arrived and works well, however: As mentioned by others the on button on one of the devices is not accessible, the directions and other reviews mention padded labels. I find none. They also refer to a web page which is not accessible either. Annoying.	1
73	Not as good as advertised	I live 20 to 40 miles from my local stations, though there are others in the 65 mile range advertised. I've been using an old channel master uhf/vhf and expected much better reception with the antenna I purchased. Picture quality and signal strength dropped significantly when I installed the new antenna. I was extremely disappointed but will admit that Amazon was behind the return process 100%.	1
74	Lemons abound	This camera is terrible. A few weeks after ordering, the picture turned red and won't return to fully colored. Googling the problem, it's quite widespread. Dont' waste $20.	1
75	Good Value for the Price	Comfort is the first thing I notice when trying out new earbuds.  If they&#8217;re not comfortable I won&#8217;t wear them so the sound quality doesn't come into play until they pass the comfort test.  These Belkins are very comfortable and I don&#8217;t feel like I have something stuck in my ear that needs to come out.Now for the sound quality.  Very good sound, with good distinctions between treble and bass.  I don&#8217;t like a lot of bass so I can&#8217;t comment on the &#8220;Extra Bass&#8221; that is mentioned in the description.  But for the money, these earbuds deliver the type of quality sound you would expect.	0
76	Works GREAT!	"Head unit is in a 2001 Malibu but I replaced the stock speakers with some nice Polks.I wanted to run my iPod nano so I purchased a ""Monster"" brand cassette adapter at Target as that was the only brand they sold. The bass / treble was poor (In case your using a Monster brand you have to max out the MP3 players volume and minimize the car stereo volume to prevent static)and the overall sound was ok at best. 90% of the volume traveled to the right side speakers which I THOUGHT was inherit of any cassette adapter. After only 2 weeks the Monster adapter (which by the way cost almost $20 !) broke. I returned it for another at Target which had the same crappy sound. This one worked for less then three months before the sound degraded so bad I threw it in the trash. Typical of Monster brand products they are massively over priced pieces of junk.Anyway, after reading all the reviews on the other adapters I purchased the XM by Belkin.(with the Belkin my iPod volume was best when locked at 50%)WOW, the sound is really clear and the bass sounds great too. The system now sounds like I have a CD player or ""proper"" MP3 connection. Sound is balanced almost perfectly on the speakers too. Ive only been using it for a week so I cant comment on durability. However for less then 1/4 the price of ""monstrous crap"" I have no problems buying another.5 stars!"	0
77	Two batteries AND a dual-power charger for less than one Panasonic battery	Too bad Panasonic felt compelled to punish owners using third-party batteries by disabling the &#34;power remaining&#34; indicator when these are installed. Fortunately, battery life is long enough that one will probably last all day, and if/when you need to swap you will probably only need to do it once. The charger worked well for me on both 120V (US) and 240V (non-US) electricity. I haven't tried it on a 12V (automobile) circuit, but it's a nice bonus to have that feature in case I ever need it.	0
78	Use for PS3 Controller	This works perfectly to charge my PS3 controller while playing games. The cable is the perfect length and very durable.	0
79	MY STAFF LOVE THESE	i have about a dozen of these because my staff uses them all of the time. plus for the price you can't go wrong with buying these.i use mines everyday as well.LOVE IT	0
80	Exceeded all my expectations for audio use	I bought this MP3 player more than a year and a half ago and I have been using it quite a bit ever since. It has exceeded all my expectations, and I am very happy with it. I even bought an extra two-year warranty thinking that any piece of portable electronics is likely to have some kind of problem within two years, and then I will be provided a new one after it breaks. Well, it looks like I'm going to be out that extra money, because it still works perfectly despite falling a few times from tables and chairs, etc.I have looked at videos and photos on this player, but the screen is a little small to really enjoy. The quality is pretty darn good for a 2-inch screen, but it's still a 2-inch screen. So I use it almost exclusively for audio -- mainly for listening while commuting, walking or jogging. It is perfect for that.The sync function works great with Windows Media Player 11. The battery life is good for at least eight hours of audio even after 1.5 years of steady use. The sound is really wonderful, although playback is so sensitive that the defects in low bitrate MP3s are more obvious than on other players I've used.The only big downside is the proprietary cable. Sony loves proprietary formats that no other companies use (they won't even put firewire on their computers -- they use a lame powerless version of it instead). So if you lose the cable, you have to go find a replacement and pay a premium. I wish Sony would just use a mini USB cable, but I'm not going to hold my breath.But I haven't lost or damaged my cable yet, so my experience has been entirely pleasant. I can highly recommend this player, and when I go to buy my next one, Sony will be high on the list of the products I consider.	0
81	Suprisingly comfortable design and good sound	I have found that I do not like earbuds, the little &quot;clip on&quot; individual ear headphones, and pretty much anything other than traditional &quot;over the head&quot; stereophones, so I was pleasantly suprised when the Sony MDR-G series actually fit me well. I have the MDR-G57 and MDR-G52 and enjoy both. The G52s were very tough and lasted over three years before the bass started to rattle and the earpeice started to come undone.Overall, these are very good heaphones but seem a bit overpriced. Many people with long hair or earings may find them uncomfortable or hard to put on and take off because the headband goes *behind* your head not over your head. However, big heads and big ears are not a problem as I have both.Some major pros to the design is that it is very comfortable for me (even for long term use for homework and stuff), very durable (mine have lived in my backpack for the years they survived), and generally nice looking (especially the G52 -- I could do without the yellow on the G57s).However, no matter how you slice it you are definitely paying a premium for the Sony name. They are durable and sound very good, but for the money you could buy better sounding headphones from Koss or Aiwa and enjoy your music more. Definitely look at other brands, and if you like these Sony's the most go for it. You won't be disappointed.	0
82	Easy to install, insanely thin	This thing is like paper thin, seriously pictures don't do it justice. A breeze to install, I connected the coax to the tv, put this on a book shelf next to the tv, and viola, 60 channels or so in fresh to death HD. Its about 1/2 - 3/4 size of a regular piece of paper and just as thin.	0
83	Length matters!	What kind of review can I make about a set of cables? They work as advertised, and the length is perfect for me.	0
84	Good product	Happy and easy to instal	0
85	GGS III LCD Screen Protector Glass for Nikon D300S D300	I have bought this product before for my other cameras and I love it very much. I have not put this one on my new camera but I am sure it will not only fit but it will be as good as the others ones I have in my other cameras. I love this product.	0
86	Phillips SPS6038A / 17 Home Charging Station	This Phillips SPS6038A / 17 Home Charging Station is definitely energy efficient. Plus the affordable asking price and the fact that this nice-to-have handy device doesn't take up much space at all is most assuredly an upside to owning this item. Only possible downside I see is that the Charging Station takes awhile to recharge itself - a good five or six hours. Wanted to also make note that this gadget has no set-up or assembly necessary whatsoever. You simply take it out of the box and it's ready to use. How convenient is that? Recommended.	1
87	this was a used item sold as new	I bought this as NEW device, came with nick on screen and half of a screen protector. I dealt with that. Installed AVG then found out it has been rooted. Nice, I also purchased a warranty for this stupid thing. This company is selling things as new when they are not and allowing you to purchase warranties that are not even good. I will NEVER do business with this company again. I hope Amazon takes action against this company because this is fraud. If the tablet was indeed new and was not rooted then the tablet would most likely get 4 stars.	1
88	"Recommended to those looking for a 40"" SMART LED TV"	This beautifully clear, life like, brilliant colors, thin, efficient, Smart TV will guarantee to please you.Only issue is Samsung Software need to provide an updated download that allows wireless keyboard and mice to connect to this model.Otherwise I am very happy with my choice.	0
89	Love These	My portable hard drive came with a very short cable that was inconvenient.  These are perfect and long enough that I can set up my drive in an out of the way place.	0
90	Yep	"I love this keywoard. The keys stick out a lot, like the mechanical keyboards. It's very easy to type on, and it's very fast. I'm so glad I got rid of my old ""flat key"" keyboard."	0
91	Nice protector	Great for the price, easy to use and fits perfectly on my tablet.  Definitely had to put a screen protector because my 3 YO daughter likes to play with the tablet, so a little bit extra protection was needed.	0
92	don't spend your money	i purchase this hood back in may.is horrible docent tide,cams lose. the one star is for the shipping, was on time	1
93	Worked	I loved having the raid option, and this worked great. I have since removed the HD's and use them on a media server, but this style is a bit out of date now anyways.	0
94	SanDisk Ultra 64GB mircro usb	I tried this just because you can never have too much storage or backup.  It easily connected with both my Note 8 tablet and Note 3 phone and I was able to transfer / copy files quickly.  The 2.0 speed was not a problem.  It does the job efficiently and easily.	0
95	Hdmi	I accidentally put the review for this cable under  HDE HDMI Female to Mini HDMI Male Adapter.  They go together well.  Works just as well as the more expensive models.	0
96	Works great	I needed to add some firewire ports to my laptop in order to connect my new digital video camera (Canon HV20). This card worked great. Just plug and play. I had some problems with a different kind of card I got somewhere else but this one worked perfectly.---------------------[...]	0
97	Screen Protector	I followed the instruction and watched the video, it worked perfectly.	0
98	The mount of mounts ...	"Excellent mount for the Garmin 800 (500). Installation is a snap. It is by far the best mount so far for the Garmins. It places the unit is just the right location - and adjusts some for different riders, etc. It is VERY secure. I really like this unit.Some have mentioned that they ""think"" that the new mount (metal) will cause excess wear on the Garmin mount (plastic). I tend to disagree. I use Gun Butter lubricant (works well on chains too). Very little goes a long way and greatly enhances the mounting process and will minimize any wear.Excellent Amazon vendor - VERY fast delivery."	0
99	New Toy	"Hi all. I am new to Android Tablets so please bear with me.The unit arrived a few days ago. Was considerring Returning it. Mainly for Financial reasons. Decided to open and try the unit. All I can say is, Its not bad. Not perfect either. Once powered up. Connected to my Secured Router. Installed the 3.1 Update. Adobe 10.3. A couple of Apps. Setup a G-Mail account. Transfered a few pics from my PC. Transfered some MP3s. Then ran into a problem. The Eee Pad prompted me for a ""Force Close"" on the Music Player since it stopped running. Software glitch apparantly. Even have it connecting to my ISPs Home Page.Right now its mainly a ""Toy"". Until I figure ways to use it productively."	1
100	Used to upgrade my dead TiVo HD Series 3	Used to upgrade my HD TiVo Series 3 a few months ago. So far so good. Don't notice any additional noise, either. Great price.P.S. If you happened to use one of these to upgrade your TiVo, note that when the hard drive is imaged and replaced you must do a full reset. Otherwise after a lengthy partial reset it will still complain ambiguously that there is an error and you need to call support. The problem seems so result from the newly formatted disk having a unique ID that the TiVo doesn't trust. Simply doing a full reset is the only thing that will solve that.	1
101	Great TV....so far!	"I purchased this TV about a month ago, but was hesitant because of the negative reviews. Thus far, I am happy to report there have been no issues with ""green blobs"" or brightness fluctuations. I am extremely happy with this TV's performance and with Amazon's pricing and delivery."	0
102	Real bargain	For this price, it is real bargain to get two batteries. The original Canon battery is more expensive than this whole package! First the battery lasted only a couple of hours, but I found out that my camera had the GPS turned on continuously, even when it is powered off. Once I disabled it, the battery was as good as the original Canon battery.	0
103	BEST OTA Tuner for PC - bar none!	Tried Hauppage TV tuners, tried HD HomeRun tuners, even tried standalone Chinese PVR boxes.  NOTHING comes close to this tuner for OTA signal reception quality for digital ATSC broadcasts, both high VHF and UHF.  Just as good as my expensive Sony TV tuner where the other products just fell flat.  Use the latest driver and Windows Media Center (for FM reception as well) because their software is terrible.  But the hardware is top notch.	1
104	Great lens	I've been very satisfied with the technical performance of this lens.  It's absolutely great, I love the very short depth of field, and I use it for a lot of portraits.  It's also fast and long enough that it's a good choice for some indoor situations (graduation ceremony, plays, etc.)My only regret is that it's lacking auto-focus. With such a short depth, it can be incredibly challenging to get the subject sharply focused.  Hand holding and focusing by eye, half my images turn out blurry.  More, if there subject is energetic.  It's critical to use this lens with a stationary subject, and ideally on a tripod.	1
105	Works good..... for PC	This thing works amazing for PC despite its intensely long cord.  However, a few months ago i got a MAC and of course.... no bueno.  For some reason i cannot get it to recognize.  So if you have a PC.. thumbs WAY up.  I MAC.. don't waste your time.	0
106	Surprisingly Good HDMI Cable	I purchased one of these cables based on a review I read just to give it a try. I figured I would only be out a few dollars if the product wasn't any good. I was pleasantly surprised how good this cable works. I used this on my HDTV and the picture quality is just as good as another expensive cable I had purchased for another HDTV. I decided to purchase additional cables to use with my Blu-ray player and Roku boxes.	0
107	Works fine	Wouldn't work on one of my two USB 3.0 ports, but turns out it was the port and not this hub.  It's working ok now after putting it on the other port.	0
108	Works, connectors are good	If only APC cables weren't so hard to figure out which one I needed, I'd be happier, but that isn't this seller's fault.  This product worked just like I thought it would, and our network cluster is now happily talking to each other to check on the status of the UPSes in the room.	0
109	Failed after six months	Don't buy this - poor quality.  Does not work after six months.  Tried on three PCs, and new batteries.....	1
110	Highly Recommended!!	This mount served the purpose of being a mount on my dashboard that helped me avoid suction cup markers on my window.  Works very well!!  Easy to just plop on your dashboard and move around as you see fit.	0
111	Superb device! Even for the technically impaired - like me.	Frankly, I didn't really quite know what I was ordering, I was hoping that it would allow me to save a couple bucks and avoid buying a blu-ray device just to stream movies on a secondary television.Well, wow!The Roku LT Streaming Player not only was a breeze to set up, but it is compact and (other than its purple color) is very unobtrusive.The directions are very straight forward and easy to follow. The hook-ups are simple. The network connections are the only things that might throw you for a loop if you can't remember your password...but other than that, the set-up was a no-brainer.It DID take the Roku three trys before it acknowledged my network even though I had used the correct password.After set-up, I spent at least an hour browsing through the tremendous list of available free channels and reviewed some of the pay channels. With this simple little box, I've been able to transform my television into a very cool entertainment system.I love this thing!	0
112	Great product!	This  32 GB flash memory card worked great on a once in a lifetime trip!  I used it to back up my photos and I am so glad I got it!	0
113	It can worked to upgrade firmware for KK2 board with proper cable	I used this USBASP to upgrade the firmware on my KK2 board for my quadcopter. Unit didn't come with proper cable so I hade to buy a separate cable that was difficult to find. Otherwise, product works well. Just for my application, the lack of a proper cable was a pain. I guess that is more my fault than the products. It would be nice if multiple cables were provided.	1
114	Another great item for desk	This made my life easier (I got 2 since i have backups and photo files for graphic work). I hate cords...hanging from the back of desk. Cut into my desk, utiized 1 drawer for all my connections and hooked up with these hubs. PERFECT. No cords to trip up dogs. A+	0
115	Does what I wanted	I was asking some co-workers how I could attach my computer to my TV so I could watch movies and TV on a bigger screen, and they suggested the Roku.  Well once I found the right port it worked exactly as I was told.  I put in the numbers for my wifi and it came up, I had to figure out my remote to get it turned on to the HMDI but that was not hard.  I had a little trouble finding the Amazon Prime set up but once I found the right page I was able to set it up with the password.  The box is very small and the remote has very few button, which for me is a big plus.Now the bad part was the Netflex free is only for a free trial, as is Hulu Plus, so I decided I did not need them. Not everything is free, but there is a lot of free stuff.The really good part was once I started searching for channels I found an amazing number of interesting ones.  Plus I don't have to put in the ones for shopping or sports that I would have received even if I did not want them on cable.  There is more than enough for us to watch.  The Amazon Prime works great, I just mark the programs I am interest in on my watchlist and there they are.  Since have not had regular TV or cable in years everything is new to us.  My husbands favorites are there Pawn Stars, American Restoration, American Pickers and he can sit comfortable in his chair and not crowd around our computer.There is not enough hours in the day for all the things we want to do.  Plus I can listen to my music from my Amazon Cloud.I would definitely recommend it,  If you are interested in movies the Netflex or Hulu Plus may be the way you would want to go, and it is possible we will consider one of them in the future.  Those are a lot more economical than cable,and in my neighborhood the cable companies have not replaced the cables in years.	0
116	Love my ipod	I received this ipod as a gift although I did ask for it. My sister has the iphone and had downloaded many applications from the istore especially games. I was hooked but I didn't want to pay for the extra data program to own the phone so the next best thing was the ipod touch. It does everything that the phone does without the phone or the expense of the service. As long as I am near Wi-fi I can search the net, check e-mail etc. at no cost. Many of the applications are free from itunes and even when there is a charge it is minimal when compared to buying a separate program for your computer or game box. It is very easy to use for one who is not exactly a techno wiz. I just absolutely love this ipod.	0
117	Great product	Great product to use for lots of things. Glasses, iPods, iPhones...just about anything that requires intricate tools to work on.	0
118	Bose Companion 3 Series 2 Multimedia Speaker System	I just recently purchased this speaker system and it is excellent! If you are looking for basic computer speakers that will put out the same volume and quality of sound as a full-on receiver stereo system, then these are the speakers for you. However, there is only one issue that I found and have also seen other people mention in their reviews, and that is if you frequently listen to quiet music, such as classical or easy listening I would not recommend this system to you. There is a slight buzzing/white noise sound that is audible at low volumes, and when playing lighter music such as easy listening or classical you will be very annoyed by this. I listen to classical music when I study, and this is when I first noticed the light buzzing sound, but I have my old speakers to listen to the lighter stuff with. If, on the other hand you listen to mostly rock, dance, rap, hip-hop, r&b, or any music that requires some volume then these speakers are perfect for you. I really enjoy the fact that I can blast them at loud volumes without any distortion, similar to a proper 3-stacker stereo system (which honestly is what I expect from a premium brand like Bose). Cheers	1
119	It's music to my ears	Although I've used a Plantronics Bluetooth earpiece, I must admit that I've never been crazy about the idea of an earpiece.  The Jabra CRUISER2 Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone is so much more comfortable for me to use while driving!  After I realized that it would take a couple hours to charge the unit, I plugged it into the car and it was ready for pairing by the time I arrived home from my day of errands.  The pairing was intuitive, the voice basically guided me through the process, and I was making my first hands free, earpiece free call in a minute!  The clarity is excellent and the battery is outstanding.  Because it's so cold outside now, I've charged it again, but the battery was still alive.  I love the option to charge the unit either in the car or via the usb option.  This is a lightweight unit, small in size and the clip is lightweight but sturdy.  It doesn't contain extraneous buttons or lights, just what it needs.  Listening to music through the FM worked, but I doubt that I'll use the function often.  All in all, I really like this speakerphone and see why my favorite warehouse club store offered it through their coupon booklet recently.	0
120	Nice tablet with some flaws	Pros: light weight, screen resolution, security, battery life, on board GPS antenna to use with any offline Navigation, Google Play store rocks.Cons: No flash player, it still does not support Tom Tom Navigation app, speakers are not loud enough, I have heard and also noticed that after some use screen starts squeaking from the edge.  So far no major issues.	1
121	Works as expected	Received the new battery very quickly and it holds it's charge for many days with normal usage.  No complaints, so far.	0
122	You MUST get this if you are into the SDR dongles!	I absolutely love this thing.  Only thing that could be better would be placing the USB power port on an end with the other connectors.  If you are into short wave listening and have an SDR dongle you gotta get one!  NooElec has great customer service too, not that you would ever need it.	1
123	Excellent Speakers, But Not Perfect	"I was in the market for new computer speakers to match my Apple Cinema Display and white/silver desktop theme of my Mac setup. I came across these speakers in a Mac forum and was taken with their simple but fresh look. I found these speakers new on Ebay for $60 and promptly bought them.I also currently own the Creature II speakers by JBL. They are essentially the previous version of JBL computer speakers before the Spot's were released. I have to compare the Spot's to the Creature II's of course.I'm very happy with sound of the Spot's. Just as I was with the Creature II's. I like the look of the Spot's even more and they take up less space on my computer desk. The subwoofer looks awesome with it's round shape, a rare feat for a subwoofer.My biggest gripe is the subwoofer switch. It is awkwardly placed next to one of the speakers ports in the back of the subwoofer. When you go to adjust the sub level, you can't help but hit your finger on the cord directly next to it. That is annoying. Also, there is one knob for ""sub-level"". The Creature II""s had 2 separate knobs on the front of the subwoofer. One for bass and one for treble. This only has one. I'm annoyed by the lack of control in that regard.However having established that, it doesn't take away from the sound experience and aesthetic look. I'm using the white covers and it looks awesome. A HUGE warning though, if you want to use the white covers, you must remove the black covers that come on the speakers as default. The instructions do not mention that the black ones need to be removed first, and it is not as obviously a conclusion as you would imagine. So make sure you remove the black covers first if you are going white. Lastly, taking off the covers is not easy. You will need to pry them off using the instructions noted. Don't be afraid to push, it's the only way they will come off."	1
124	Scrolling is unusable	There are many things I like about this mouse, but, unfortunately the scrolling is so terribly unusable that the pros don't really matter... To scroll you need to slide your finger up and down surface of the mouse.. You need to actually slide a significant distance before it actually activates the scroll. Once activated the scroll is very jumpy to the point of frustration...	1
125	awsome	loved this item i have it a five because it fit my computer perfect and the fact that i paid so little was even better.	0
126	Beautiful industrial design. Awesome picture quality. Clunky interface.	"I love the beautiful industrial design of this player. Great picture quality and useful audio analog outputs.  I don't care much for the trackpad remote or the clunky interface unfortunately. You have to swipe up and down to make selections. The wireless N only works on a 2.4ghz band so you can't connect to a 5ghz N channel.  I wasn't able to use the iPhone remote app as I suspect I'm on a ""different"" wireless network--the 5ghz band.  Amazon video prime works and in HD -but I can't turn off the beeps and alert navigating in the Network apps screen which will get annoying.  Still a great value!UPDATE: The proper iPhone Remote Controller App is Panasonic Remote 2012 (Doh!)UPDATE:  To turn off the beeping sound while navigating the web apps look for the settings within the Network app page itself and not the player settings.

127	Doesn't work	I bought this mp3 to bring on a tip. I didn't feel it was necessary to buy an expensive mp3 player. I guess you get what you pay for.	1
128	Solid state is faster	I added a second hard drive to my new computer and I chose a sold state device because of the speed. I do some video editing of family pictures and videos and this really help speed things up.Make sure to initialize the device after installing it, or windows won't see the device in the file manager	0
129	a must have item	If you don't have one....get one. I leave it in my truck so it's ready to be used when I travel. Who needs radios anymore. Sometimes I use my phone for pandora but for everyday use it's the Ipod. One day I hope to fill it up....hahahaha. Fat chance of that!	0
130	Flash Drive	New in package.  Works perfect.  Very fast great product.  PNY is a good MFG.  I have a another pny flash drive for 5 years and it is still fine but wanted a backup.	0
131	Matte Ionic Screen Protector for Note 8	Really like the way this screen protector cuts down on screen glare. Would have given it 5 stars but the package could use a bit more instructional info.  The kit includes a white patch that looks like a sticky tag you would write a note on, but it is actually a cleaning tool.  Use it to wipe off your device before putting on the screen saver.  This patch picks up tiny bits of dust you can't even see, and helps you get a bubble free placement of the screen. The screen does not interfere with the touch and pen functions of the Note 8. The kit arrived very quickly after ordering and I would recommend this to a friend.	0
132	Okay sound quality.  Great for instant pairing and sharing your speakers with other devices!	Pros:-NFC makes pairing super-easy....most of the time.-Connection is reliable and range is really good.-Re-pairs quite easily when you come back in range.Cons:-Bluetooth doesn't always pair the first time. Usually pairs the second time.-Sound quality is noticeably muddy over plugging directly into speakers.  Half of you will notice.  Half of you probably won't care.-No option for phone audio to play thru speakers. Only passes media and system sounds.  Granted, most people probably don't want this device for that reason.  It keeps your calls private even when you're paired and mutes the audio so you can hear your phone ring (doesn't ring thru the BT speakers), so that's good.	1
133	This is an unbelievable product	THIS WORKS SO WELL, I'm TEMPTED NOT TO GIVE IT TOO MUCH PRAISE AS SOMEONE MIGHT THINK I WORK FOR THE COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURES THESE!They work from an RF remote, which means you can be at one end of your house and turn on a lamp at the other end, or whatever you wish (120 V AC). I turn of one of my living room lamps after I get into my bedroom!  They are also great to use in a home theater environment.  Best of all, the price is fantastic.	0
134	Great fit - took some getting used to	The more I use this, the more I like it.  It was awkward at first but the more I use it, the more I find different ways to hold it.  I love the fact that it comes on and off sooooo easily and works great with my gel cover.  The only thing I wish is that somehow it was cloth covered.  It is just rubber to skin and that's not horrible but would be nicer with cloth (this is the only reason for it not getting 5 stars from me).Overall, worth the purchse, but don't give up on soon.  Use it for at least a week before you decide if you like it or not.	1
135	Programmed One Day	Item was defective, so I had to return it.  It accepted my wifi info initially during setup.  The following day it did not recognize the remote nor my wifi info.  I was able to sync the remote but was never able to reprogram the box.I replaced it with two Roku 1 versions and have not had any problems with the replacements.  In conclusion, I am an avid Roku user and love the little boxes.  I own four and have given three as gifts to family members.  This one has been the only one that malfunctioned.	1
136	The Best 60mm Macro on The Market	"My friend just bought this lens and let me check it out. In one word Fantastic! It is among the sharpest lens I have seen in a lens of this class even wide open. I have a 50D and that camera is pure torture on lesser lenses, but the Tamron has no problem keeping up with its hunger for resolution. The other two reviewers commented on the price, but I don't see that as a con as you are paying only a little more over Nikon and Canons (other brands to) for an extra stop. This is worth it to me. Most would argue you don't need the extra stop on most macro as you usually want more depth of field and this is true, but this lens also is intended for portraiture  and for that the extra light does come in really handy, even when doing flowers and what not a shallow DoF can help add interest to a subject.This lens does not have the build of say an ""L"" lens but does seem sturdy and have no doubts it would hold up well even if it got some rough treatment. The focus ring is smooth and responsive combined with its light weight makes this lens a joy to use. I will defiantly be ordering my own copy of this lens as soon as I get paid and can't wait. I highly recommend this lens to anyone looking for a macro in the 60mm range."	0
137	This came in handy	when I was staying in an apartment that had almost no way to connect my appliances and laptops in my bedroom to my living room where the Internet access router (and other appliances) were.  The wireless functionality on the Internet router was useless, and kept dropping connections, so I turned it off, used this relay in the bedroom to connected to a wireless access point attached to the Internet access router.	0
138	Not Bad	It's a good backpack. I bought it to lug my old HP laptop around and it works well as just a regular backpack too. I actually don't need to carry around my laptop with it but it does a great job with the laptop when I need to bring it around with me. All in all, it's a good buy.	0
139	Great Design, Good Quality Video	This little Sanyo doesn't shoot HD video, but the quality is very good nonetheless. It's a great fit for an average-sized hand and very easy to keep steady. The overall design is solid, and it produces great color. It picks up sound remarkably well, too. Forget shooting stills with this little video camera, though. They're better than nothing... but not an awful lot better. On the other hand, for design and handling ease no other camera I've tried beats the VPC-CG65 for shooting video.	0
140	Great cable, works at any distance without an issue.	I use this cable to plug my laptop in to the ethernet cable across the room. It wraps around the walls without an issue, and is very durable.	0
141	Works very well	Not too much to say about it, but have had it installed for about three weeks, and have had no issues. I have a 5 port version also on my network, which is about 2 years old and has been working fine, and continues to do so.	0
142	nice graphic card	I am not sure how to review this product in terms of its specs.  So I will just mention my experience with it in plying Skyrim.When you are on the highest setting, the game might stutter from time to time. But after lower several settings (e.g. shadow detail to medium), the game runs flawlessly (even with the skyrim HD mod).	0
143	It's good but not like I expected!	The backpack is rather large, a little bit larger than I though it would be which doesn't make perfect for my use.The thing that most threw me away were the side pads that are rather noticeable. There is no way to not have them hanging there, it makes you look odd especially if you are covering an event and need something to hold everything and still look professionalThe inside of the bag was nicely padded but the laptop sleeve seemed a little bit too tight. The Amazon Basics logo on the front just screams &#34;cheap bag&#34; for some reason. The handle on the top isn't too great and the interior of the front has a very cheap plasticky/cheap feel.	1
144	Utter garbage	I have yet to get anything to actually run on this hard drive, having tested with multiple operating systems, they all freeze on bootup. Even as extra storage, I've had nothing but issues with it.	1
145	DON'T BLAME THE ADAPTER -  READ DESCRIPTION	I see a lot of bad reviews for an issue that is related to people not reading the item description and then blaming the product.Here is the correct informationThis is a passive adapter - Note passive adapters only function with keyboards and mice that are compatible with both USB and PS/2 interface.The description also states in nice BIG CAPITAL letters:THIS ADAPTER IS FOR USE WITH KEYBOARDS THAT ORIGINALLY SHIPPED WITH A PS2/USB ADAPTER LIKE THIS. IT WILL NOT WORK WITH ANY PS2 KEYBOARD.So you need to check the documentation of the keyboard.  If the keyboard is compatible with both PS/2 and USB then it will work on any pc or laptop.  If the keyboard is not compatible with BOTH ps/2 and USB then it will never work.Hope this helps any future buyers make the correct decisions.  This applies to any brand adapter including both Keyboard and Mouse adapters.	0
146	Great HDMI cable	High quality low cost HDMI cable worked well with HD digital' HD games and Blu-ray DVD's.  The fit into the receptacle is snug and the cable is flexible.	0
147	It Works!	I have looked for this in the past but this was the best buy.  The screen works well and I have not seen any dead pixels.	0
148	Good Clamps	"Heavy duty plastic is what you will find here. Some have said they were disappointed because they couldn't use them for other projects, but they are meant to be used for clamping a background to the stand (hence the title ""Muslin Clamps""). I don't recommend them for anything beyond that, but they do what they're designed to do and they do it very well."	0
149	Priceless Planet Vewing With Kids For Under $50	The kids (7 & 11) and I were fascinated looking at Jupiter and its moons with this handy telescope.  I didn't want the hassle of a tripod for the kids viewing and this works great on a table top.  I also bought the accessory kit that came with essential additional lenses and the aiming scope and a carrying bag.  Next on the way is a 2X lens to get a better view of Saturn.	0
150	Inexpensive DVD player	Just what was needed for the bedroom to fit in a tight spot and still deliver the quality picture on my HD TV.	0
151	Excellent product A++	Product seems well made and durable...and works right out of the box as was claimed...I like this product and would recommend this to anyone.	0
152	perfect replacement	This works just like the original that I lost.  well constructed, and at a good price, so it should last a long time.  If I don't lose it.	0
153	The Coolest Little Cheap Do-dad I Have Ever Owned!	This little guy alllows me the privalidge of hearing all of my laptop's music and movies with my corded high-end headphones, as well as, use the boom mic to talk into my laptop without having to buy a soundcard that would allow the same for a fraction of the cost! I can also connect this little guy to my game system that doesn't have an audio jack thse same high-end headphones become the ultimate gamer's headset! MONEY WELL SPENT!	0
154	Didn't work with my LG phone but did with Motorola phone	This seems to be a great charger - when it works. It seems to work fine with my wife's Tracfone - a Motorola EX124G but would not charge my Tracfone - an LG 500G... so I'm reducing the rating by one star. I suspect the blame may lie more on the LG phone side, but I am still disappointed that I need another charger to charge my LG phone.By the way, I highly recommended buying from a reputable retailer to make sure you get the real thing. I bought mine from Amazon.	0
155	Inexpensive wireless mouse works great!!	For $5 this is a great wireless mouse.  Even for $10!  That includes shipping.  And it works flawlessly so far.  (If it stops suddenly I will amend this review.)	0
156	great sub cover	i used this grill with the Pioneer TS-SW3001S2 12-Inch Shallow Subwoofer with 1500 Watts Max Power, it makes that shallow look like a muscle speaker,it adds about 2 inches to the outer of the speaker but still looks great, i got rid of the mounting screws that came with the grill and bought 3 inch instead, the screws included were a bit short.	0
157	Genuine Product, Works Perfectly	After reading some of the other reviews out there on replacement batteries for cordless phones, I was unsure whether I should order any batteries sight unseen. Luckily, I found this seller and product offering.The batteries I received are idential in appearance to the original Uniden batteries I removed from my phones. They absolutely look to be genuine Uniden batteries, not cheap knock-offs. I installed them in my phones about one month ago. They took a full charge and they've been working 100% perfectly since, with no problems or untimely loss of charge.This is an excellent product at a very good price that I recommend without hesitation.	0
158	Fail	I have never been able to get this to work correctly.  As I have failed at so many electronic tricks, I assumed this was all my own fault.  But I see from some of the other reviews that other people had units that didn't work.  It would have been much easier if I hadn't had to go through the device to get to the cloud.Initially I was confused about why I had to own the device if the cloud is elsewhere.  What is the deal with the actually physical drive?  I don't worry too much about accessing my data and storage because it is always on the proper devices and backed up on storage drives.  We have clouds with both Amazon and iTunes so we can collect our data whenever we want to.If my network is down at home, am I able to access this cloud from elsewhere?  This is one of the things that doesn't necessarily make sense to me.  A cloud should not be dependent on my electricity or my internet being viable.	1
159	You get what you pay for with these.	"I know that many people will consider a $40 pair of in-ear phones to be on the high-priced side, but these are actually some of the cheaper earphones available.  They do exactly what you would expect:  provide a bass-heavy, rather unnatural, sound from portable media players.  As someone who normally uses a separate headphone amplifier (most often a C&C; XO) even with high-efficiency headphones, I really don't need the efficiency of these units.  The quality and clarity of the sound doesn't begin to compare with many of the units that are only a few dollars more.  Also, these seem to be made rather cheaply, with flimsy cables and tips that don't stay in place very securely.  (Not to mention the extremely frustrating difference in cable length between the earpieces.  This is a feature that I simply can't stand, even though I have several units from other manufacturers with the same silly design.)  Overall, I would suggest that these are suitable mainly for people who (1) don't really care too much about clarity, sound balance, and quality;  (2) like a lot of bass, even if it's not in the original recording; and (3) don't have much money to spend on such things.One last, off-topic comment:  I really wouldn't put much stock in reviewers who spell ""bass"" as ""base""...it suggests that the reviewer would be a person who, never having owned or driven anything other than a Yugo, would claim that the Yugo is the best car in the world. If you don't know how to spell ""bass"", I doubt that you have much experience with audio equipment in general."	1
160	Memory Problems	I recently built my first computer. A modest design running an Intel E6500 microprocessor. Since Windows XP is no longer supported I have been obliged to install Windows 7 Home 64-Bit. Frankly, I dislike it and wish I could stay with XP. One maddening thing, is that my computer has been crashing with fair frequency. The infamous Blue Screen Of Death. These BSOD's have been happening every one or two days. The crashes seem to be caused by a different failure every time. Maddening! My Event Log showed something called Error 41-63. There's a lot of stuff on the internet about this one, so it must be a common problem.I Googled and a number of good Samaritans suggested removing the memory sticks, one by one, and isolate the fault that way. I discounted this since the computer had brand new memory and it seemed to work fine for days at a time. How could it be faulty memory? I'm accustomed to thinking of silicon based solid-state devices as failure-proof when used properly.Googling, I found out about a free software program called MemTest86. You download it as an ISO image file. So you must have a DVD burning program that will allow you to make ISO image burns. Nero is a good example and there are numerous free alternatives. You must also set the BIOS on your computer to boot from the DVD drive at start-up. MemTests86 is self-booting and does not require an Operating System. It runs automatically. I used the menu version 4.0 which seems more comprehensive. It takes about half an hour to run a full sweep of 4 Gigs of memory. It will run indefinitely sweeping the memory, again and again, looking for intermittent errors. The first time I ran the program it reported no errors so I stopped it at half an hour. Big mistake! When I did a more thorough job and ran it for 40 minutes it lit up my screen with blood-red warnings of memory errors. Tens of thousands of memory errors.Remember the good Samaritans who suggested removing the memory sticks, one by one? Well, I should have listened to them. They were right. By selectively removing my memory sticks I quickly established that the problems are restricted to my No. 1 stick, entirely. Unfortunately, I had ordered my PNY memory from Amazon on September 1st and I cannot return it as defective (even though it's Amazons fault). Oh well, Caveat Emptor. I'm going to buy a second pair of these PNY chips despite getting burned, since I will then have a guaranteed match (and one spare), for my existing good RAM stick.The first thing I will do with my new PNY memory stick is run MemTest86. If your planning on buying any kind of RAM, do yourself a favor and test the memory while it's returnable. I have learned a lesson here; some manufacturers are indifferent to quality control. I hope this helps others.	1
161	Amazing product with an incredible price	Some of the best headphones I've ever owned. They don't have noise reduction but the earpieces do a great job of keeping outside noises to a minimum and therefore acting like a noise reduction feature. They exhibit great bass ability and the mids and highs are extremely clear. You'll hear details that you were never able to hear before when watching movies. I don't think I'll buy anything else other than Sennheiser Headphones ever again. Truly a different experience that everyone should enjoy.	0
162	No problems	Bought this for a iPad Nano. Dropped the Nano and broke the screen; Was able to get on their website and print a label so I could I could send my item to them. Everything was done on their website and did not need to talk with anyone.They fixed the Nano and sent it back in about 14 days. No hassles at all. Would recommend.	0
163	Works perfectly, no issues at my house	Not sure what is going on in some of the other reviews, but this thing works perfectly for me. It splits the output from my receiver into two 50 foot hdmi cables, one to my projector and one to my LED flat panel. No signal issues at all and the unit does not get very hot at all.	0
164	Long, slim head, charges fast	This is a great charger for my iphone. It is cute in pink, extra long but still charges quick and has the slimmer head that fits through the opening of most phone cases.	0
165	Good Cable!	If you have been searching for the cable to connect your smartphone to your television via HDMI, this is it.  Its length is ideal because you do not need to leave your phone on your television or stay bent over to use it.	0
166	Great sound - easy setup	Bought this unit today and spent a few minutes hooking it up.  The box is HUGE!  There was probably 75% empty space in there.  I pulled it all out and it looks great.  We have a black Panasonic Plasma TV and a black TV stand.  These speakers look wonderful in that context.The standard sound from our TV was disappointing. It sounded a bit like speakers in a tin can.  The sound would carry all around the house and pierce through walls.  So we desperately needed an upgrade.This Vizio unit fit the bill exactly.  It is a middle of the road in terms of price.  One of the best features to me was the wireless subwoofer.  I really didn't want to have to string another cable all over the room.Positives:The sound is amazing.  Deep rich sounds with excellent surround capabilities.  I keep looking to the left or right, because that is where the sound seems to be coming from. Wireless subwoofer.Negatives:I decided to use the digital audio connection - of which there was not a cable included in the box.  That was an extra trip to the store and another $17 spent to get the setup I wanted.	1
167	Very functional	I have used it for taking pictures of articles, copying photos. Just light it on multiple sides with bright lights ( I like daylight CFL's for good color balance , low energy and heat). No glare. Can get tripod over it shooting top down or into it.	0
168	Very Nice Case for the Kyros 7024	This is a very nice case. It is faux leather but looks and feels like the realthing. For you other Kyros 7024 users it is a perfect fit and looks great.	0
169	Economical alternative to the original charger	Be careful when loading the battery. What seems to be the correct side up should  instead be facing down. When loaded correctly, the pilot lamp should be red and then turn green after complete charging. If you start out having the green light on, try flipping the battery to make proper contact with the terminals.	0
170	Works well with the PSP	I own this memory card over 4 months and no problems.  I paid lest then $20 for this....no complaints.  I highly recommend this for the PSP.	0
171	I wish they would have warned of an inherent eSata flaw	First let me say that I own 2 4-bay Mediasonic Proboxes and love them more than any other computer component other than my 6 core AMD Shuttle computer. So when I was looking into buying a third 4-bay box Amazon suggested, as they always so insightfully and accurately do, the 8-bay tower.I connect my Proboxes with eSata not USB 3.0 because USB 3.0 is inferior to eSata in data transfer speed, period. USB 3.0 also does not like to have multiple transfers going at the same time or it slows down to USB 2.0 speeds immediately.What the product description does NOT say, and the instruction booklet does say in plain English, is that some, meaning ALL HOME COMPUTERS WITH PORT MULTIPLIERS DO NOT SUPPORT MORE THAN 5 DEVICES PER eSata port. It booted the first 5 and the other 3 just spun there never connecting. This is unacceptable. Had I known this beforehand, I would have purchased another 4-bay box instead - 2 for my server computer and one for my main download computer.So what I have had to do is take out the 3 drives that I am not currently transferring data to, connect to eSata and do all my FAST, like 95 MBPS transfers. Then when everything is backed up and transferred, put the 8-bay in the server computer's USB 3.0 port and just deal with it.It will be fine in the long run. You cannot get those speeds over even gigabit Ethernet, of which I have, so it will be fine. I am just kinda disappointed.Maybe I expect too much. I just would have liked to have known BEFORE I was forced to read the paper instructions when my 3 lower drives would not connect with eSata. And of course there is no way to split them half USB and half eSata.Everything will be OK and I still love it. It has a WAY better drive door that holds the drives in place and a lock with a key. I am probably gonna keep the bottom bay empty for better air flow and use it as a safe, I mean who is gonna look for money in a computer geek's hard drive tower, right?But if you are most people, and most of you reading this are, you will be using USB 2.0 and not care about speed of data transfer. And if you have an eSata port on your computer it more than likely does NOT support port replicators, like the fabulous  un-port-replicator Zotac eSata port, so buy it, you will be very happy and all your computer geek and non-computer geek friends will be way impressed when they see it on your desk!Remember, hide your keys! hehe.	1
172	Must have accessory for the bamboo	The battery holds a great charge and being wireless is great. This is a must have for the Wacom Bamboo series.	0
173	All that glitters is not gold....	And these adapters prove it: they are pure JUNK! I bought 2 of them, and within 2 days, both were ruined. The little ring that closes off the pin entrance for smaller plug will just pop out, (at the thick end of this adapter, if you look at the picture), and after that, you can toss the rest of it in the bin, too. These are the worst trash you can possibly buy for a dollar!Truly in this case, 'Quality' and 'Adapter' in a sequence are to be considered an oxymoron!	1
174	Working in yongnuo 560II.	Canon ???  World does not spin around canon or nikon.  This is completely compatible with my yongnuo 560ii.  Deffuser works great. Thank you.	0
175	Pretty good.	Very easy to set up and decent web interface. With the current firmware the router is unable to connect to hidden SSIDs, though it can create a hidden SSID. I also wish there was some way to connect to my VPN via the router so I wouldn't have to worry about getting a secure connection with each device. Still it works well, and makes it easy to share a wireless or wired hotel Internet connection with multiple people/devices. It's also great anytime you need a temporary, portable network. It's nice to have the battery built in. Even if you don't use it to charge other devices, it means you don't have to keep the router plugged in while using it.	0
176	Nice radar detector	I've been running the V995 for about two years now, and it is still going strong.  This was my first radar detector, so I don't have anything else to compare it to, but I have been pleased with its performance.  Unlike some of my friend's cheaper radar detectors, the V995 is pretty diligent about not picking up total false positives (it's not going off while driving out in the middle of nowhere like my buddy's does).The range on the V995 is very good.  In highway driving conditions, I've had the V995 pick up radar hits easily several miles in advance.  In city driving, it's picked up radar hits in time for me to take corrective action on multiple occasions.Regarding false-positives; yes, in city driving, there are some stores that will constantly and consistently set this thing off.  If I had the money, I'd buy a higher end radar detector with a built-in GPS that can permanently tune these frequencies and locations out.  As it is, I've learned to just accept and ignore these false-positives.  The auto-mute feature is very handy to have in these cases.  The only other time I've gotten false positives is when the sun is very low in the horizon and I'm driving directly into the sun.  That has set up a laser warning a few times.  I'm not aware of any law enforcement actually running laser in this area, so I could probably turn it off all together, but it's a pretty rare occurrence and I can live with it.For the money, the V995 provides very good performance, and has proven to be very reliable.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this unit to anyone looking for a reasonably priced high performance radar detector.	0
177	The adapters make this especially nice	I'm very impressed with this product. It comes with several adapters (miniSD, SD and USB key) as well as a handy carrying case. The various options make it easy for me to move data between devices and I'm not locked into using the card for any particular device.	0
178	It works as expected	Since I already spent so much on the tablet itself, I wanted to spend less on the accessories. This one was no brainer, it is a great value for the money and I am very happy with it.	0
179	Classy	"Less than a week before ordering this ASUS netbook, I had just finished building my Phenom 9850 desktop. Needless to say, my new desktop is FAST. I have been interested in getting a netbook to replace my HP 14.1"". I lug my laptop onto campus, and have always been turned off at the weight of the machine and also having to lug around the power cord since the laptop's battery can't last 2 hours. Even with the larger battery I get a little more than three hours of use, not to mention the added weight of the battery. I found that this netbook fit the bill that I was looking for: small form factor, decent screen size, GREAT battery life, bluetooth, and decent processing speeds.My first reaction to this netbook was `wow, this is small'. Even though it is small in size, the keyboard is comfortable. I don't think if I typed on this the whole day that I would be comfortable, but I believe that going to class, taking notes and also surfing/studying between classes on this machine would be ok. I have found while typing that sometimes the cursor would move when my hands would brush the touch pad. I have normal hands (5'10"" 170lbs) and this keyboard is not a problem. I like how the right shift key is placed to the left of the arrow keys. I think for anyone who can type correctly, it is a small learning curve to learn this keyboard.I am currently using Office 2007, and this program runs without a hitch. I also have Firefox running, with Winamp (I'm oldschool) running and there is no problems. Mind you that I did purchase the 2gb ram when I ordered this machine so that helps. I did run the machine initially without the extra ram installed, and can say that it was noticeably slow. Now, there is lag but applications load and switch pretty fast. The screen is bright. Very surprised at how sharp the screen is, even with the brightness turned down. The speakers on this machine are of decent quality and loudness. I do agree that with everything possible turned up, the speakers do not get very loud. They are enough for music, but when streaming in video, voice volume is hard to hear.Programs run very smooth on this machine. There is a little lag when programs load, but that is to be expected. I would have to compare the speed to say... a P4? Everything is relative right? When I was watching Office on hulu, I did find that it was choppy, which could have been attributed to my connection and not the computer. I did play some avi videos directly from my portable HD and those ran very smooth without any glitches.Small grips about this machine is first, the beautiful black shell that will never be perfect again, no matter how much I try to take care of it and wipe the smudges away. The resolution is very strange, and you are confined to only two settings, big or small. The other resolutions run the desktop  off the screen. The 2.4mhz n wireless connection, but for now that isn't going to affect me. I do notice a high pitched whine from the machine that sounds like a fan. Good to know it is going, annoying that I can hear it. I think the back where the battery and hinge for the screen is located is a bit thick, but I can't complain too much. The weight has to go somewhere right?This machine's pros completely out weight its cons. The price was right where I was looking for, and Amazon did a great job shipping it out to me on the second day. This is a very classy machine that I will own for a long time. After being on my quad core and going to this machine, not to mention the 19"" LCD to this screen, I had to take some time in comforting myself and reassuring myself that I should not expect the same speed and performance of my  desktop from this machine. The screen is easy to get use to, but going to my 14.1"" laptop screen is like a HUGE step.  Just make sure you are not comparing this machine to something it is not. I haven't had much experience with other netbooks, but I am certainly happy I choose the 10"" over the 8.9"".*** 04/09/2009 Update ***After using this netbook for almost a month now, I have very happy at my own decision. I have installed Windows Vista onto this machine and it runs VERY well. All drivers installed without any problems, just take note that you must find the most recent drivers for the video card online or you will have some strange resolutions.The battery life is as stated. I am able to take this laptop to school and use it from 7:30 in the morning to about 6:00 in the evening without having to plug in and charge (note that I have one instructor that doesn't allow laptops during class, and I turn off the laptop between classes). I usually leave it on auto power saving mode, and have the monitor at just under 50% brightness. Bluetooth and WiFi is always on (I have a bluetooth mouse that I use).After long use, I have found that the touch pad is okay. Lots of times when I try to scroll I end up activating the zoom function. An annoyance but that's why I typically use the Bluetooth mouse.Another thing I was very pleased about is the SD card reader also reads SDHC. Good to know that this will last for a little while longer without having to purchase an adapter."	1
180	My Pink Replacement Sony Controller	This was a replacement controller my baby got a hold of it and druled on it. I tried to put it in rice to dry it out and it didn't work. Plus this was a good price for a Sony controller and I liked the color pink too.	0
181	Convenient...When You Have What You Need	We bought a camcorder several years before anything like the Flip was around and affordable.  It has sat in a camcorder bag on a shelf in the closet all these years.  It's just too bulky to walk around with when you have small children like we do.  I wish the Flip had been around then! I am glad it is now and that it's even been improved.  Compared to the old kind of cameras, there just isn't any comparison.  The one aspect that is better in the old camcorders versus the Flip is image resolution, in my opinion, but monitors weren't the same then either.  I was surprised by how grainy the videos from the Flip was on our monitor.That being said, the image stabilization in this camera works great!  I never would have appreciated how stable the image was if I hadn't read about other reviewers' experiences with previous versions of this camera.  It was so good that I didn't even notice that it was there.  I recorded several videos of my 7 and 5 year old daughters dancing.  The sound was clear and crisp.  The picture needed to be rotated on my computer, and it took me a bit to figure out how to do that, but I was able to.For people, like me, who haven't had a Flip before, there is Flip software on it. The USB Flip port has to be completely inserted into your computer.  When it is, the red lights will turn on on the front of the camera and the camera itself turns on automatically.  If it isn't completely pushed in, the camera will turn on, but your computer won't recognize that the camera is there.  The flip port won't fit in my USB port on the front of my computer so I need to purchase the FLIP Video USB Cables (or a similar cable)Flip Video USB Cablesto act as an extension.  It has to be plugged in completely or else it won't work.  I did try to use it on our netbook and though the netbook recognized the camera it wouldn't transfer the videos automatically like my desktop will.  The netbook wanted me to install software on the netbook and then it gave me an error message.  I was surprised by this, but not too concerned because it will be far easier to save the videos on our desktop.  I was able to get it to transfer the videos tonight, but the camera didn't like being pushed in the way it needed to be, so I'm going to go pick up the needed cable tomorrow.It is extremely easy to use.  The power button is on the side and the red button in the center is the record button.  I don't think they could make the camera any simpler.  It's one of the easiest cameras to use that I've ever seen.  The part that isn't as easy is transferring the videos to your computer.  But, if you have the right cable, you won't have a problem.You will want to buy a cushioned camera bag (small size) to protect the camera.  It only comes with a small thin bag (just as all still and video cameras do) to put it in.  If you happen to misplace the small users guide as I did yesterday (it is a very small piece of paper), here's the link to the guide online: [ ... ]  I am a mom of 3 kids, so I do have a busy household.  It's nice to know that you can always find things online when you need them.In the camera is an enclosed rechargeable battery.  You cannot replace the battery, so when the battery dies, so will the camera.  I was given the advice with previous rechargeable batteries to always let them run down before you recharge them completely.  Otherwise, they don't tend to hold the charge as well.  Since I am not a techie, I do not know if this is true of the battery in this camera, but I would be very curious as to whether it is.  There is a note in the camera to charge the camera for a full 5 hours before the first time you use it.  The camera will turn on when it comes out of the package, so don't miss this direction.  I wish you could replace the battery, but I know that many devices today are made this way.The only other thing I wish was better with this camera was the picture resolution of the videos.  But, someone from Flip has commented on one of the other reviews and done a great job explaining why they went with 720p instead of 1080p.  His comments are definitely worth reading.  Personally, I'm happy with the camera the way it is and I'd rather have the image stabilization than the 1080p resolution.Overall, this is a really great camera. It'll fit in your back pocket, your purse, or in the glove box of your car.  That's the best kind of camera to have--one that is easy to pick up and use and small enough that you'll actually take it places and use it!	0
182	perfect	it does what it needs to do - connect my computer to my bluetooth devices.  The support program is versatile and allows many different applications.  It all installed easily and quickly (XP).  The device is so small that I can leave it permanent on my netbook even in its protective sleeve, so I never need to know where an adapter is.  All for a great price.	0
183	Nice Charger That Will Handle Two USB Devices At Once	As I get more and more devices that charge via USB it is nice to have a few chargers at your disposal.  The fact that this NukePak charger will charge two devices at once makes it doubly useful and a perfect charger to keep in your bag.  It charged any device I threw at it fine from an Apple iPad to an Amazon Kindle Paperwhite.  It's a sturdy little power pack that charges your devices as it should.  Highly recommended.I received a sample for the purposes of doing a fair and honest review.	0
184	Awesome tablet... *Until*	This tablet is nearly perfect. I've had it for a week, and so far everything works as expected.*It's my first experience with Android, but I love the fact that the Gmail app handles universal inboxes, for those who use them like me.*The camera's a bit funky, even with Android 3.1, but I honestly don't see myself using it much. I haven't tested out Skype video chat yet.*The Asus keyboard works great, I see no reason to switch to the Android keyboard and give up my top row of number keys!*The one and only thing that bothers me: the video playback. Some videos play just fine: for me I've had some luck with .mkv files, but not so much with .mp4 files (no sound; stuttery frame rate) and some .mp4 files (frame rate is fine, but no sound). I'm using the most popular video player, Moboplayer, so I just assume that the patch for Tegra 2 isn't perfected yet.*In other areas: web browsing is great - the tablet renders pages very accurately. The microSD card reader works fine and is recognized without delay. The music player is great too, though it would be nice to have a progress bar. Battery lasts an entire day and a bit more without a hitch.All in all, a great product, especially for a first-generation Android tablet.Things I want to see: Microsoft, please release an MS Office suite ASAP (especially OneNote for university students like myself!). That's the only advantage the iPad has - there's full collaboration between iOS and Mac OS (along with iWork) since they are one and the same organization, while Microsoft and Android (Google) are quite separate. I'll be waiting.*UPDATE*I forgot to mention that in the past week I set up the SplashTop software, which allows remote access to any computer that is turned on and connected to the internet. It is similar to LogMeIn, for those familiar with it, but runs far more smoothly - even 1080p videos are at watchable quality streaming from my desktop! (to be fair, I haven't touched LogMeIn for about four years). You can set up SplashTop for access from within the same network AND from outside the network. Setting up the latter requires a bit of fooling around with the port-forwarding settings inside your router; the SplashTop website offers a great guide to doing so.This newly discovered feature increases the awesomeness of this tablet (well, any tablet) further!UPDATE #2:Sorry, I should have posted this earlier but I've been busy:After about two weeks of happily using the tablet, the power button became unresponsive. Amazon's excellent customer service replaced it right away. The replacement unit, however, could not update from 3.0 to 3.1. I returned the second unit for a refund.I'm very disappointed with this experience and I hope it was just an isolated incident. Unfortunately, there are several reports of both problems in online forums. I have owned two Asus netbooks before and they are quality products. However, something must have gone seriously wrong with the quality control for the Transformer. I hope to be a potential customer in a few years, but not anytime soon. In the meantime, I'm a happy owner of theAcer Aspire TimelineX AS3830TG-6431 13.3-Inch Laptop (Cobalt Blue Aluminum).	1
185	Great Start, Small Hiccup, Overall Good	"I bought the mSATA version of the Crucial M4 mostly for the form factor and have not been disappointed at all. I also bought it for the fact that it's one of, if not THE only mSATA SSD I know that doesn't use compression algorithms (a la SandForce).  The Marvell controller here works great and Crucial/Micron have done a fantastic job with their firmware.  Just as I received it (about 2 weeks ago) they sent notice of an updated firmware that fixed most all extended use failures that people have been getting in the past.  I myself have not had a single problem.  As I said in the title, it may not max out the synthetic benchmark programs or have the fastest write specifications on paper but it does have one of the best reliability track records out there and it doesn't use any sort of super over-provisioning or compression to get the job done.  It also has one of the most attentive companies backing it and troubleshooting the problems that do arise, so that makes it a true winner in my book.  You won't be disappointed in the performance if you're upgrading from any standard platter based HDD.  Also, if you're looking for the small form factor and something to plug directly into a desktop motherboard or laptop to save space, it accomplishes that goal for you as well.For a little background on the hardware, it's been first used in an ASUS Crosshair III Formula motherboard in a SATA II socket through the Syba adapter.  Afterwards I transferred it over to a new build on the Maximus V Gene where it directly plugs into the mPCIE expansion bracket (also SATA II).  For those interested, it does also work wonderfully of course in the SATA III sockets on the new build which allows for faster read speeds.  I however prefer the convenience of the direct motherboard interface and the fewer cables associated therewith.  My perception is that it does not suffer for being attached to a SATA II socket.  The response times are just as snappy and Windows 7 still grades it at 7.8 so I'm happy.  If you have questions or concerns, feel free to comment and I'll try to answer as best I can from my own experience.*******UPDATE ON 28-Oct-2012*******Well.... two days after the return window to Amazon, the drive decided to fail... No warning, just suddenly a blank screen.  Upon reboot, the drive cannot be found.  It seems another reviewer here has the same problem with the most recent firmware revision.  The drive is no longer listed at all in the BIOS in any mode (IDE or AHCI) after a crash and hard reboot.  *SIGH*.  I'm just glad I kept my Raptor in it's original image condition (just a month old is all).  Now I have to see how or if Crucial handles the RMA and whatnot.  Here's hoping my faith is not betrayed.  :-(*******UPDATE ON 31-Oct-2012*******I visited the Crucial forums after trying the tech support email.  I managed to find a ""power cycle"" reset method to allow the SSD to self correct.  It worked and I didn't have to follow through with an RMA.  The drive came back to life without any data loss thankfully and it's working just as well as it did before!  The issue I experienced was with the 01MG firmware revision.  It is known to Crucial/Micron and hopefully they are working on a fix.  I am glad they do actually support their products and that the community is active in finding fixes.  They did respond very quick to the support email I sent as well.  My faith in good companies held true!  =DHere are the links to those fixes for anyone who might also have a similar problem.

187	Buy it!	Roku is great with all the apps it has. And the apps just work so much better than any smart TV. Easy setup and simple to use. I'd recommend this for anyone sick of paying for cable.	0
188	Solid design, pretty good noise cancellation, and better than average sound.	"Update: After just over 1 year from purchase, the headphones only play from the left side and the right side has a short in the wire where the headphones bend at the hinge.  Because the warranty is only 1 year from purchase, it means I have junk now.  By contrast, my Bose headphones I purchased 5 years ago continue to work great.  This put Beats into the overpriced category due to poor design.Pros:- Fold flat design fits into a small form factor case - slightly smaller than the Bose QC15 case.- Noise cancellation is reasonably good - the noise cancelling doesn't seem quite as good as the Bose QC15s.- Audio quality is personal preference - these are punchy with the bass, but not overwhelming.- The ""silence button"" on the side of the phones is handy when you need to quiet music for a quick conversation or drink order on the plane- Design in general has great details - from the product packaging to the magnetic battery cover, this looks and feels high quality.Cons:- The solid construction means slightly more weight.- I found these to be less comfortable than the Bose when wearing for a long period."	1
189	I love this Palm Z22.	"I have used this PDA for 2 months.  I have installed a Chinese OS in the PDA, a whole bible, several dictionaries, such as English to Chinese and Chinese to English.  Each dictionary has >50,000 words.  I also have installed many games and applications to this PDA too.  It still has some room for me to install more applications into this Palm Z22.  Great PDA!  Because it is simple, I do not need to worry about ""virus"".  I would like to recommend this PDA to all my friends.However, its picture quality is not good!  That is the only disadvantage of this PDA from my point of view!"	1
190	Good quality cables for easy clean hook up.	Needed a variety of cables to get the TV DVD and old VCR all hooked up after purchasing a new hi def flat screen TV. This assortment was all that I needed and everything is very clear.  Went to radio shack for sticker shock and Walmart for no help at all and ended up with these. Just had to wait a few days for shipping but well worth it.	0
191	Fantastic Image Quality, Better than IS Version	OK, first off, I won't repeat how professionally sharp this lens is. It's expensive, and there's a reason. Image quality is stupid amazing. This is the best zoom in its focal-length class.But--the IS version is not quite as sharp as this non-IS version. I know, I know, people may balk at the statement, but the Canon tests and the real pro photo reviews don't lie. One reason is less elements bogging the image. Only in a hand-held lower light situation will the IS version get you a sharper image, no doubt, at slower shutter speeds such as 1/30 etc. BUT, you'd better be taking shots of a museum or something, because if the subject is moving (people at a wedding for instance), you've got subject blur and IS becomes useless. But in a brighter setting where IS doesn't help because you have a fast-enough shutter speed (that's right, IS doesn't kick in there), this non-IS lens wins quality-wise, ESPECIALLY tripod mounted.So you'd really need to have a dedicated reason to spend 500 bucks more and be willing to carry almost a pound more of lens weight for IS*. The non-IS lens is heavy enough as it is. I use a monopod and boost up my ISO on my near-noiseless Canon 5D, and viola, I've gained the same 2 to 3 stops that IS can give you, and at a faster shutter speed to boot. Oh, credit where credit is due, I'm fairly sure the IS version has weather sealing where the non-IS does not. I wouldn't take my lens out in the rain anyway, but that's a point to note.For those of you wondering about the f/4 version, I can see that being very useful if you do nature photography on a tripod and don't need f/2.8. The f/4 is WAY lighter in your backpack. Pick up a tripod ring on the popular auction site (f/4 version doesn't come with one), it's way cheaper there. Again, IS not needed here at all. For the price of the IS f/4 you can get the non-IS 2.8.This 70-200mm 2.8 non-IS is the best lens I've owned image-wise, and the 500 bucks saved can be used for a 100mm Macro or a 580EX flash or a couple TCs or a 50mm 1.4 (plus a good LowePro backpack) or almost the cost of the 17-40mm L. I think it's a no-brainer there!*UPDATE 11/14/2010: The specs on weight are wrong on Amazon, the non-IS is actually heavier than they say, weight difference is only 5.6 ounces. Also, the new IS version of this lens has been redesigned and now boasts the same image quality of the non-IS. However, the non- IS is 1300 bucks, and the new IS version II is 2249, so that's almost 1000 bucks more (although you can save 200 bucks during the current rebate). If money is no object, go for it, the image quality is there now!Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras	1

193	Protective Case	This is a nice protective case with easy access to multiple memory cards in one place. An excellent method to assist in organization.	0
194	Haier TV	"This 7"" monitor is used in a portable monitor rack for TV production. The monitor is used as preview monitors for the cameras. It is very light and gives very good response for a small color monitor. It is not used as ""On Air"" monitor. We do not need the audio side of the unit. Be aware that it does not provide ""loop thru"" capability. We connect it to our switcher preview side. Its great to have four of these little units going at one time in one rack. As far as the reception from the antenna...It is no very good in the area I live in. Too far from a transmitter!!! Good Luck"	1
195	Excellent carema for the price	You can't beat this camera for the price. It takes great pictures and has built-in WIFI, what else can I say ?	0
196	Great Camera	The 30D has been a great camera.  It focuses fast and the frame capture rate...WHOA...5 fps.  Raw quality is excellent and JPG is expected.  Flexibility in configuration is fantastic.  This is a winner even at 'only' 8 megapixels.  Trust me...megapixels don't make a better picture, lenses do.  Get the great price on this winner camera.	0
197	Great Coax Cable	It's a coax cable, it works great.  Price is awesome.  What more can you honestly say about a coax cable?!  This one is outside in the AZ sun and we've had no issues with it so far.  Will try to update after we have a summer under our belt...	0
198	great buy!!	Fits perfectly in my Samsung HLT5676SX DLP TV. Was very easy to install, basically one screw holding a small panel on left side, you pull down the locking metal lever, pull out old lamp, insert new one. Very easy, this piece went in smooth with no problems, perfect fit.This lamp actually felt better built than the original one. The original was flimsy, this one seemed very rigid.Make sure you look at the right lamp BEFORE you order and READ THE MANUAL for your TV when attempting to repair it!	0
199	Good deal	Was only looking for one battery, but could get two to have one for a spare. I recommend this product	0
200	best flash drive ive ever had	i dont know if its as fast as it claims, but its been better than any other drive i have had.i love the looks, the texture for extra grip, the cap is good if u carry it say in ur pocket vs lint and i felt it was plenty fastsadly i lost it when i moved and i cannot for the life of me find it. when i need another one ill be buying this	0
201	Great cover but snagged	This protector is extremely easy to put on and it does a decent job. I did get a snag in the cover though, from what I am not sure. Could have been keys? Or dirt? No clue. Either way, I will need to replace it after about a month of use.	1
202	Excellent Quality	Nice case (even luxurious I'd say) very well made and fits the camera snugly, offering excellent protection. No metal snaps. Closes with a generous-sized piece of velcro, which should last for the life of the camera depending, of course, on how often you open and close it. Has a leather sewn-on belt loop, which I use to hold a spare battery, albeit precariously. If it had even a bit more room inside to hold that extra battery or SD card (the battery is very thin) it would be perfect for me.	0
203	Probably not the best in the market now	It works fine, but isn't the best. The processor can't handle more than 2 tasks at time and the remote control is note very user friendly.	1
204	Still working 2.5 years later.	You can't say that for every laptop charger. The insulation is breaking where the cables meet the plugs, but it still hasn't given up.	1
205	Amazing value, why spend more?	"This remote from Neewer (which has the Shoot brand on it) is not just similar to the one with the Canon name brand on it, it is the same unit. The only difference is that to get the Canon-branded remote you pay a whopping 83% more.  The selling price for this remote was so low I was actually concerned that it was either junk or the seller was a fly-by-night.  Not true on either score. It worked perfectly out of the box on my Canon 60D, was well packaged, came with battery and a basic instruction manual and the seller had it to me much sooner than I expected (it doesn't qualify for Prime so I expected to wait at least another week). Shipping charges were MUCH lower than expected - basically actual cost to the seller.The remote itself isn't rocket science so I won't go into a lot of techie details. It is small enough to fit easily in the accessory pouch of my camera case, comfortable to hold and has a large curved disc that helps you slide your thumb exactly over the raised release button without having to look at the switch. That makes it easy to hold inconspicuously at your side. You also have the option of setting a slide switch on the back of the case to permit a 2-second delay after pushing the button.  That way you can push the button and put your hands wherever you want to.  A third option is if you set your camera to ""bulb"" one push will open the shutter and a second push will close the shutter ... no need to hold the button in.Most people don't like self-timers for good reason - the mad dash to get into the frame with your group usually results in unnatural photos. With a wireless remote you can concentrate on having fun without the stress.Time will tell how long this remote will last, not that I plan to use it every day anyway, but if it fails I'm not too concerned. I can buy 6 more of them for the price of one Canon-branded unit.PS - I'm choosing to reinsert the little plastic tab that came with the remote to keep the battery from making contact (so it didn't accidentally discharge in shipping). It's easy to slide back in and I think it will help prolong the battery life if the button gets pushed while in my carrying case."	0
206	All-in-One Desktop Media Player	"This is conceptually a brilliant product. A digital photo frame with a built-in MP3 player. I have purchased quite a few of these and I estimate that there is a 5% chance of getting a defective unit. Therefore, as soon as you get it, you would be well advised to ensure that it is working properly (especially if it is going to be a gift).That aside what is really convenient about this product is the remote, this allows you to control the volume, and the music and the slide show.Apart from just showing still photos, this frame also has a Video Mode where it will play AVI and MP4 files. Some lower costing frames will not have this capability.Here are the specifications for this product:- Display type: 7"" Full-Color TFT LCD (3.5"" H x 6.0"" W)- Display Resolution: 480 x 234 pixels- Cards Used: CF, SD/MMC, MS/MS Duo, xD- Audio Format Support: MP3 (32-320kbps, CBR/VB), WMA- Video Format Support: AVI, MP4- Photo Format Support: JPEG, BMP (14MB)- PC Interface: Standard USB 2.0, 5 pin Mini USB (cable provided)- Plug and Play Support: Windows 98se, 2000, ME, XP; Mac OS XThis is wonderful product and can provide many moments of happiness, once you ensure that it works as soon as you get it."	0
207	Rediscover your music.	Wonderful sound that you will want to experience.  I tried them first with a loaner amp and then with a higher-end Yamaha and with both the sound is just wonderful.  A little more bass with the loaner but that's just eq.  You'll want to spend a fair amount of time getting your l sub crossover tuned.  At 200Hz+ there is not an artifact in sight.  I feel like I understand intermod much better now that I have heard these speakers, as the effect here is so much less than any others I have heard.  So clean.  I'm not an audiophile and I feel like don't have the jargon to describe them properly.  They're just astonishing.  All said, they aren't very efficient so you'll need a bit of power (100W max), and if your setup is like mine you'll need to turn all your other speakers down to match the lower output of the LS50s.  These are first my really good speakers and I've rearranged my place to accommodate them; they're that good.  I'm going through the record and CD collection again start to finish!	0
208	Works Pretty well...	I bought this to watch content from my NOOK HD+ (via the optional HDMI adapter) on a Sony 32inch tube television.  When streaming content from DishAnywhere, the video looked very decent but wasn't edge-to edge.  Not fatal.When watching a movie that was downloaded to the Nook from the Google Play Store, the image was AMAZING and there was no margin around the image.Overall i am very impressed but am baffled why there is no power switch when there are other switches.The blue LED doesn't need to be quite so bright!	1
209	Great for price.  Instructions terrible.	I use this camera to record activity at my front door after some trouble.  It's visible through the window, but I don't care.  It records and plays back as a USB camera connected to my Mac.  Quality is good.  Downside is the instructions are TERRIBLE so I don't really know how to traverse the menus... which are not clear... to turn on night vision when needed.  But hey, it's cheap, so you can't complain a whole lot.  And who would listen?	1
210	economical and effective	I bought this wrist strap to use with my Fuji X100. I had considered some leather ones, but in the end, decided to go with the economical choice. I am very happy with this strap. It is comfortable and does exactly what it's supposed to do.	0
211	A really useful, fun camera	This camera is packed with great features and special effects. As someone who used to use film cameras, I'm still amazed by how much processing a little pocket camera like this has built in. Things like slow-motion video and diorama effects are very fun to play with.Images seem a little less punchy than from my old PowerShot A510. I think it's mainly because the ELPH 100's colors are less saturated. You can increase the color saturation in the menu settings, but the more neutral colors are more flattering in portraits.Low light performance is quite good, which is important because existing-light photos look so much more natural than flash photos. I got impressive shots in a very dimly lit restaurant by using Low Light mode and letting the camera handle the automatic white balance.The body is smooth, so it's easy to pocket. It's a bit slippery, though, so use the included wrist strap.	0
212	Nice little camera/video cam for the price one drawback	Used the Playsport while in the kayak and also while whale watching nice video for the most part. The only setback is the zoom. Picture and video quality quickly suffer when using the zoom.Don't discount getting this though, I had it completely submerged in brackish water with no problems. For the price, you can't lose	1
213	Must have adapter.	Performs as expected.  Would be nice is it was made of a sturdier material, but experienced no problems in using while taking outdoors photos on vacation.  Can experience a little trouble screwing on filters or lens.  Must be careful not to cross-thread.	1
214	Comfortably wraps half headphone cord	I've used 2 for a single pair of ear buds.  It does keep them untangled for when I need them.  I would fully unwrap the top and unwrap the bottom only as much as needed depending on where my player is.	0
215	Runs nice	I have a 500gb apple HD in this, runs nice smooth and cool only problem is the connecting wire will come loose and DC the HD if it moves.	1
216	Works great with one minor flaw	I recently got a subscription to Netflix. My wife wanted to be able to stream movies to living room tv. I heard some good things about the Roku and plus it had MLB season pass on it.I got it in the mail. It was sent in the actual Product box no extra packaging to protect it. Luckily it was OK upon arrival. I am not sure if it was sent by Roku or Amazon.The main problem I had was we still have an SD CRT TV in the living room. I got this unit because eventually we are getting a HDTV. So when I first connected it to the SD TV the image was all scrambled and I could not get it set up. So I connected to a computer monitor that had HDMI input. I had to set the video output to 4:3. I disconnected it and hooked it back up to the SD TV, evidently when you disconnect power it will revert back to 16:9. So I hooked it back up to computer monitor and wrote down what sequence of buttons to push to get it back to 4:3. Reconnected to SD ran through the sequence of buttons to push and still scrambled in 4:3. I turned the unit off with remote and back on and then the image was fine.Also, at least for me it was kind of a pain to get the Roku, Netflix activated. It would kick out the code if you wait to long to enter it from Netflix. So I got the laptop out and got next to the box and as soon as the Code appeared online I entered it. That seem to work.Documentation and Support FAQ is skimpy. I never got a chance to see if there is a forum.Considering the problems I had once I got it set up and working the box worked far better than I had hoped(at 1.5 mbs) so I gave 4 stars. It is even better watching Netflix on TV than a computer. A netflix account at $9.00 a month is better than HBO, Cinemax and Showtime combined.If you have this box hooked up to HDTV(HDMI) you should have no problems setting up the unit.I hope this review helps.Thanks Roku and Netflix for making TV fun again!	1
217	All that x10 should have been	"While good on paper x10 was a huge disappointment in real life (posted a review). Fuji  learned from that experience and this time created a real jewel. The focusing speed, the menu system, Q menu button, better sensor, more grippy control wheel and less flimsy multidial (the latter was a nightmare in my copy of the x10). The camera is compact, so it feels very ""dense"" (good for holding stable), perfectly fits in the hand with very comfortable grip and excellent tactile feel of the grainy finish. I don't buy cameras for their looks and I like them stealthy but the ""silver"" version actually has a grey gunmetal finish that is simply stunning with thex20  black body.This is still a P@S camera (with many advanced features) not an all-in-one all-around solution. There are more pocketable/lighter cameras with better battery life (Sony RX100, Olympus PL5, Nikon 1 [heavy as x20, less bokeh but super fast focusing, good DR-colors in RAW, good battery, interchangeable lenses, also comes in pink or white for a bit less adventurous informals...]). I wouldn't take it on a several days backpacking trip, sports or low-light shooting (at least as the only camera). Taking pictures of running kids/pets is a challenge, you'll miss a lot but one out of 10-20 that is in focus most likely will be a keeper. Other reviewers covered it in details.The x20 is not for everyone, to get most of it one needs to be comfortable with manual/semi-manual settings but shooting with the x20 is an experience."	1
218	DO NOT GET	This was not a good idea getting. All of the gems were falling off! In less than 3 days of having it on my iPod, almost half of the gems were gone.... trust me when I say DO NOT GET	1
219	Husband loved His new Camera Case	It's great to have the Nikon name on the case! My husband loves it. It's quite a great price, perfect!	0
220	Most useful accessory for a Garmin	I travel a lot, which means lots of rental cars.  Having to try and suction cup the old holder to the window all the time was a pain and after awhile the suction cup wouldn't even hold and my Garmin would end up on the floor at the first bump (since I spend a lot of time driving back roads, that was often).  This friction mount holds well, hasn't slid at all even when on very rough gravel roads and when coming to quick stops.  The Garmin is easy to manipulate when on the mount.  I couldn't be happier with how this has worked out.	0
221	Great replacement charger!	At first it acted like it didn't want to, but I put my fitbit in and out a few times and it connected. I have given this seller to several friends and they have had no problems!	0
222	Great value for a great quality case!	Great build quality, fits snugly and securely, and the price is the best part. It's very inexpensive for an iPad case (versus Belkin with similar features). I just wish they had Prime shipping eligibility. Considering buying more colors so I can switch it up from time to time.	0
223	Leather Rotating Jacket Case	You get what you pay for.  It protects the ipad just fine, but is a bit floppy and not as snug as I'd like.  I wouldn't buy this product again, nor recommend it.	1
224	Unable to See Screen	I bought this phone because I had previously liked other Nokia phones I had purchased.  In addition, I thought it was a great price for a smart phone.After using it for a couple of months, I believe I have wasted my money.  My biggest complaint is that the screen is impossible to see when one is outside.  Yes, I changed the background to white, which does make it easier to see.  However, the background on the music player does not change and remains black.  I like to walk outside and listen to music, but unless I play a really long album, I cannot even use it.Needless to say, I will now be getting another mp3 player and using the phone features only.	1
225	Works	There are similar models available in better price. This unit worked right out of box and sound is ok. Build quality is flimsy	1
226	In Case	Bought this just in case I may happen to need it. I was planning on buying the iPad Air. But first, I shopped around and ended up, 360, to Apple! Well, got to wait for it some other time. I hear some change to it any way. The description states it can be use for many device. It does work. I got it on time too before the due date also. That's a good company and thanks. This item it's like a saying &#34; it's better to have it and NOT need it and Need it and not HAVE it!&#34;	0
227	Super long lasting battery	This battery gives me from 1000 to 1400 shots. I do not know if there are any batteries that last long. Besides, I have a 28-300MM lens. This zooming needs more than regular battery. Two battery fully charged can give you a weeek worth of shooting in my opinion. It was a good investment to me.	0
228	Sound quality is decent, but no headset for phones	The more expensive Sony equivalent has better audio quality and a headset capability. But these are smaller and lighter to wear and have more thoughtful integrated controls on the phones themselves. Not bad as a backup, but when these break I will probably be going back to Sony.	0
229	Well....	This unit arrived in 'working order' however not a single LED light functions on the unit.  As a result, I can not tell or diagnose any issue or concern.  Because of what all is involved in getting it set up, I just decided to keep it as it does work....it sends a nice signal, but if I ever have a problem, I will not know what is at issue given I have no visual guidance.  This was the second purchase from the company that has been defective.	1
230	Painfully slow autofocus	This is my first non-Nikon lens and I'm sorry I bought it. While the lens is OK, the focus mechanism is incredibly, painfully, agonizingly slow. The focus mechanism must make three full revolutions to go from closeup to infinity, stopping and stuttering all the way, and passing the focus point until you attempt a second squeeze at the focus. I'm shooting with a Nikon D700 body and I'm accustomed to near instant focus with the high end Nikon lenses. I needed a longer Macro lens to go along with my 105, and the Nikon 200 was not available at the time I bought it. It was also listed as quite pricey in the wake of the Japan Earthquake. I gave the lens 3 stars because the image quality is decent, but it would have been a 4 star had the focusing mechanism been screwed down more tightly so that three rotations were not necessary to go from closeup to infinity.	1
231	Solid, heavy duty wall mount	Mounted my 70&#34; Vizio to this and it works great.  Very stable, very well built.  Heavy, but I fell confident that my TV will stay right where I put it.Be smart when installing the unit and use a stud finder.  :)	0
232	Great Keyboard and Mouse for Awesome Price	Item exactly as described and came in original box from Logitech. Installation was painless and both mouse and keyboard are working flawlessly.	0
233	Doesn't Live Up To The Hype Exactly	The big selling point in favor of this PowerSnap kit which contains two components ----- an access case and a snap battery ----- is that it promises more than 2x the battery power.  You can stay charged in three ways. By snapping the SnapBattery to the Access Case with an iPhone 5, you can get an instant source for backup power. By purchasing a wireless charging surface or using a public one marked with P you can charge the access case with the iPhone 5 for a rapid charge. The SnapBattery can also be charged using a wireless charging surface with the same specs. You can also recharge the SnapBattery by using the traditional method using a USB wire.Since I always seem to be running out of juice and end up with a dead iPhone, the backup battery is a nice feature and very useful in a pinch. It's just that the case isn't all that great. It is cheap looking, has a big gap at the bottom that I don't like, and the case offers little to no protection to the phone.It seems to me that a good design would benefit this concept and make it a desirable accessory. As it stands, the only time I might be tempted to use this product might be when i know I am going to need more battery power.Another negative is the cost of a wireless charging surface that is compatible with this phone. I rec'd one through Vine and like it, but the fact remains that this case doesn't really do much to protect a phone if it is dropped or bounced around.The other negative is that I have yet to get 2x battery power under any charging option. My experience has been about an additional 50% battery power. Maybe I am missing something, but 2x it isn't.	1
234	reasonably good	This is a nice audio cable for the price. Although not mentioned in the specs (come on, people, customers need this info), the cord is about 6 feet long (do your own metric conversions).The cord is sturdy but flexible, and about the same diameter as the plugs (3.5mm or 1/8 inch). The plugs are molded on and solid.All in all, it seems well made and quite adequate. There isn't a lot one can say about an audio cable beyond that.Oh, does it work? Yes, it works just fine.	0
235	fail	this prouduct looks good but doesnt work at all. i recommed buying one at walmart or something because you are just waisting time with this product	1
236	Great, for what it is.	I bought this because I had heard lots of great hype about it and at just $35, how could I not try it?  Installation was easy enough, although a little oversimplified to the point that minor details on how to actually use it were omitted.  I don't recall the device telling me that there would be an icon at the top-right of my Netflix app.  But that only took a minute to figure out.  Using it with my iPhone is a breeze and an awesome experience.  Not only being able to toggle captioning without pausing the movie, but I'm also able to close the app and use my phone normally without interrupting the stream.  So far, flawless in that respect.HOWEVER, when you're not using it, unplug it.  That sucker gets HOT.  I don't know if it's an issue with mine or what but keep an eye on that.I'm happy with it, overall.  But I feel like it could do more and from what I understand, there should soon be support for local media.  We'll see.  In the meantime, it's a low price tag and while it does very little, it is very good at the little it does.	1
237	Go for purple!	I love this mouse! Purple is one of my favorite colors and its my first cordless. It worked instantly and I am happy with how it feels and looks.  The price is excellent too.	0
238	Four Stars	Works perfectly. Thought it brought a 3.5 mm cable though.	0
239	Garmin hand held GPS	The simple clip available from Garmin provides quicker access, better attachment,less weight and cheaper. The carabiner  attachment is too floppy as you walk.	0
240	D-Link DCS-930L	great camera REMEMBER no night vision !indoor use only,I have mine enclosed so I can use it in my back yard.easy to set up.Cloud works great !	0
241	Worked for my HTC Incredible	"I am using aPlantronics MX505 Windsmart Boom Headset (Tan)with this ""buddy' 2.5 mm Female to 3.5 mm male with my HTC Incredible and it works perfectly.  I also tested an IPhone 3 and it worked with that phone also.  The quality of the adapter seems pretty good to me.  Little else to say at the moment?  Well, other than I'm still waiting for that 90 degree angled connector that was going to be discussed with the designer...right?"	0
242	works great, cloned quickly	works great,haven't really noticed much speed increase though. Also WEI couldn't rate it at first and then when it finally did rate my index is still 5.9 for hdd same as before with a 5400rpm standard hdd. So I think WEI is still not rating it (impossible to have the same rating with a 7200rpm hybrid drive as you would get from a 5400rpm standard drive).	0
243	Great	Great hard drive, it has a perfect size, not too big, not too small and it's very useful to carry arround.	0
244	Nice one to have	Its working fine and its a nice thing to have in your gear. Using it with my NEX 6 specially doing long exposures.	0
245	Works great.	This indoor antenna, along with my Zinwell ZAT-970A Digital to Analog TV converter box (which I also bought on Amazon), allows my old tube TV to bring in all the local stations. You can move it around to find the best location for maximum station reception. It weighs next to nothing and has a nice, long cord on it. For the price, it's a nice piece of equipment. I've had mine for 1.5 years and it has continued to work very well.	0
246	Power Adaptor, need it for traveling.	Works as stated and an necissity if you travel with your FLIP.  Love the FLIP!	0
247	What more can you ask for?	this purchase was perfect for me as i wanted a bag i can take biking that would also hold all my gear.  I have 1 dslr 1 point and shoot, approx 4 lenses, 1 flash, 2 extenders, and various others.  Exactly what i wanted for cheap =]	0
248	Small and large capacity!	I use this in my car, it fits flush on the radio head unit! I can store a bunch of cd's in mp3 format and play for days. The only thing i worry about is losing it while bringing it in the house to change cds! It's tiny!!	0
249	Great earbuds for a great price	These earbuds produce a great sound for a 13 dollar price. The isolation is there, but you can still make out noises around you. This could be a good or bad thing. They sound comparable to the JVC HAFX33 marshmallows but i feel like these HAFX35's fit better. The FX33's seemed to have had more pronounced bass than the FX35's but the great bass is still there. Overall it sounds great and they're 5x better than stock ipod earbuds. The sound is more full, not tinny, and it you can hear a very large range of sound frequencies.	0
250	Great purchase	Bought these for my MacBook and it has worked out great. Only thing that sucks is it collect dirt inside after a while. Nota fan of keyboard skin, can type faster without it but does protect keys- after a while it turns yellow on keys you use frequently.	1
251	Sent wrong radio	The wrong radio was sent. Decided to keep the one they sent after price was cut. Hope this is not a sign of things to come though.	1
252	Now I Am Spoiled......	I remember back in the 70's my mother got a Walkman. She was thrilled that she could enjoy music on her walks. While the size and capacity of the devices have shrunk and grown respectively, the tether between ear and device has remained. Until Bluetooth that is. I keep my iPhone in my pocket and my s305 on my head and have complete freedom of movement. I have an iPhone 3G, which did not support all of the remote control functions of the s305 until I upgraded to iOS4.2.The headphones are comfy in my opinion and stay put for what I use them for. I walk and ride my bicycle with them no problem.So far, I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend them to a friend.One change I'd make is longer battery life. I got over 6 hours on a charge but I'd like more. I think 8 would be the sweet spot. That is the reason for only 4 stars.	1
253	work	They do the job. They are not as workable as some others but they were cheaper. I have them on most of my electronics and they do a good job. Thanks!	0
254	Very good wireless headphones	They are not Bose, but most of us can't tell the differences in the sound quality, but we can tell the difference in the price. That gives it a 5-star in my book. The set-up is easy and you can walk around and still hear the TV. Or, you can list to one thing and let the rest of the family watch that stuff you're not watching, but listening to anyway.Good quality, good bass - I thought the sound was excellent, but then I am a little hard of hearing. So why spend a bunch of money?	0
255	120 hertz is glorious but this monitor is not.	I bought this model based on reviews stating it as one of the top 120 hertz monitors.60 hertz to 120 hertz is like going from a mechanical hard disk drive to an SSD drive. You will see a big difference with games and even the desktop.Pros:120 hertzNo dead or stuck pixelsCons:Backlight bleed across the bottom of the monitor.When displaying at 120 hertz, there were stationary scanlines on the left side of the monitor (3-4 inches long particularly in the bottom-left corner). Noticeable on the desktop and playing games. After troubleshooting I determined the monitor was defective so I had to return it.	1
256	Not too clear	I bought one of these earlier and it was OK.  This one has a terrible picture and no mounting bracket.	1
257	Not bad for the money	Not horrible but it can't be compared to pricier units. The BIGGEST issue/drawback is that it will NOT accept a standard Arca plate. This means that if you use an Arca base on your mono for long glass you have to change out plates to use this.  If they were to modify the base by a few mm to allow for Arca size plates this would be a solid 4 - 4.5 stars.	1
258	Perfect Camera Bag.	I have to say, this back pack looks amazing.  It looks like a prop from a futuristic movie. Great style, very comfortable and did I mention it looks good?  There is plenty of padding so if you drop your bag, your gear should be safe. Can be easily pulled around front to grab your camera.  I have in this bag: Samsung HD camcorder and two batteries plus charger. Two lenses for my D60 and the body itself.  4 secure digital cards, 3 batteries for the D60 and its charger and cleaning supplies.  And this is the small version of the bag.  You can also choose to order a larger one. Do your self a favor and get this bag..	0
259	This is a terrific product	This tuner is everything it's advertized to be. I have Windows 7 Media Center; it immediately recognized the tuner and with a few simple steps programmed all the channels I could recieve on my television. It even found some digital channels that I don't get on my TV. I would HIGHLY recommend this tuner to anyone with Windows 7.	0
260	Tank-like protection	This case is HEAVY, but practical, with both a hard plastic and a grippy silicone layer surrounding the back and sides of the iPad and a dual-purpose hard front cover that unfolds to become a viewing stand. It's probably overkill-- more protection than most people will ever need, but if you are hard on your devices, are prone to dropping things, or if kids will be using it, then the OtterBox Defender is a worthy investment.	0
261	Philips DC291/37 30-Pin iPod/iPhone/iPad Alarm Clock Speaker Dock	This is a great product. It is convenient for charging over night, easy to use and the sound is full and rich. We received the product quickly after placing the order and it was securely packaged.	0
262	protection	What a relief to have the protection for the lens I have. It is very delicate. I use it close to the ground a lot and have confidence that only the protective lens will bet scratched. Easy to remove and clean both sides.	0
263	Good Stuff!	The card is very good and it supports some functions in my Olympus camera that other manufactures don't.  I didn't have enough time to test it in full though.	0
264	"Really like the ""gold"" color"	I had purchased the usual silver-colored ones in this brand before and really liked them.  But I was wanting different color flash drives so that I could recognize them as being &#34;especially important&#34; - so these gold ones were the ticket.  The Kingston Digital Data Traveler flash drives are my favorites and have never had problems with them.  I don't like the plastic retractable ones - these have a very solid feel and are easy to put on a keychain without fear of losing them..	0
265	A fine and useful cable	"This cable seems well made and sturdy. It serves an important function - extending the SATA-type power adapters inside a PC to power an extension card. Frequently the built-in SATA power cables are short. Other extension cables are only about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long. This one is twice as long, which lets it reach the ""far corners"" of a desktop tower. Very handy.Note, though, that this just extends a SATA power connector. It does not serve to convert the older style power connector to a SATA. A different adapter cable is needed for that application.If this review was useful, please let me know by voting for it."	0
266	REASONABLY GOOD LENS FOR THE PRICE (BUT HAS SOME ISSUES)	"First impressions with the lens:1. Manual focus ring action is very smooth, but unfortunately, this is not an internal-focus lens (my own fault for misunderstanding the specs), and the front of the lens barrel turns about 30 degrees lock-to-lock with the focus ring.  This will be a minor inconvenience when I use a polarising filter.2. Zoom ring is a little stiff, but not the worst I've encountered on 70-300 telezooms selling in this price range.3. The lens comes with a case (cheap but better than none at all) and a lens hood.  The hood is very deep and has no cutout for accessing a polarizing filter, as the Pentax-brand lenses do.4. The Macro mode is simply an implementation of close-in focusing at 200 to 300 mm zoom.  The minimum focus distance is about 3.5 feet even in macro mode so you can't get really close to the subject.  Maximum magnification is 1:2, so this isn't really a ""dedicated"" macro lens like the Pentax 100mm (prime) Macro, which lets you get within a few inches of the subject and has a 1:1 magnification.  On the other hand, the retail price of the Pentax is almost four times what this Sigma costs.UPDATE: June 2010. I just took this lens on a vacation and shot about 100 frames of flowers and various other small objects in Macro mode. I am pleasantly surprised at the images; they are sharp and bright. Depth-of-focus and bokeh were better than I expected from a lens at this low-end price. The 1:2 magnification was enough for what I was shooting. If I was trying to photograph something really tiny, like an ant, I suppose a 1:1 lens would have been better, but this Sigma did a pretty nice job.5. With the lens mounted on my Pentax K20D, the image in the viewfinder throughout the zoom range is surprisingly bright and clear.  I had a Tamron 70~300 that I sold last month: the viewfinder image through that lens always seemed dark, even in full sunlight.  The optics on this Sigma seem noticeably better.6. The autofocus motor is quite fast and not as noisy as the motor in my Tamron 70-300 (see #5 above).  In Normal mode, autofocus seems pretty reliable, but in Macro mode at close distances the autofocus hunts a lot and often fails to lock. This could also be the fault of the camera itself; the K20D is by no means the class leader in autofocus, as many reviewers have commented. I was hand-holding the camera for this test; the autofocus probably performs better in Macro mode on a tripod.  Of course Manual focus is always an option and could be a better choice for Macro shots to begin with.7. This lens is heavier than I might have expected at this price. This could mean that more of the parts are made of glass and metal instead of plastic, compared to other telezooms in this price range.8. This lens has a manual Aperture ring. There's no way to use it on my Pentax K20D, which has only electronic full-automatic aperture controls, but I suppose it's there to allow the lens to be used with older Pentax models (film cameras?), that have a mechanical DOF preview button.9. At 300mm the lens gets pretty long, yet the extendable front section of the barrel still feels well-seated and has only a slight amount of ""wiggle""; less than my Tamron 70-300 did at any rate. The zoom ring is stiffer than I'd like, but on the plus side this could mean less ""zoom creep"" than a lens with a looser or smoother zoom ring action.10. The internal stop point for the focus ring seems to be actually ""beyond"" Infinity focus.  Be aware of this when manual focussing.Preliminary Conclusion:This Sigma 70-300 seems to be a step better in overall quality compared to the Tamron 70-300 (which costs about $40 less).  I expect to shoot several hundred images with it over the next couple of months, and will expand this review with image quality comments next month. For $210 I don't expect quite the level of overall brilliance that one gets from a Canon ""L"" series lens, but if the image quality matches the apparent build quality, I'll be happy with this as a ""walk-around"" lens that won't break my heart if it gets damaged somehow. By comparison, the nearest equivalent Pentax brand lens is the DA 55-300 zoom, 58% more expensive than the Sigma at $330.  The Pentax DA does not have an Ultrasonic focus motor, or internal focus optics (so the front of the barrel probably rotates), so the Pentax has no immediately obvious functional advantages over the Sigma.  And the Pentax has even less Macro ability than the Sigma, with a maximum magnification of only 1:3.57 (0.28x).  So unless the Pentax has substantially better optical quality than the Sigma, I think the Sigma may be a better value. One could take that $120 price savings and invest it in a 50mm f1.4 Prime (always a nice lens to have on hand for low light or portrait situations where you want as shallow a DOF as possible).Of course if you have really deep pockets, you could spring for Pentax's premium DA-Star 60-250mm telezoom, for $1308 :oUPDATE September 2010I've discovered a downside to this lens. I won't go so far as to call it a design flaw, since many other lenses have this same issue, but you should be aware of it. Like all lenses in this price range, the barrel is not environmentally sealed, but what makes this a serious issue with this lens is that both the front and rear elements telescope in and out a LOT as you turn the zoom and focus rings. The actual numbers I measured are 32 mm for the rear element and 60 mm for the front. The consequence of this motion is that a lot of air gets displaced in and out of the lens as you work the control rings, and with that air, the lens can ingest all kinds of other, undesirable gunk: dust, pet hairs, insects, you name it. I have only shot about 400 frames with this lens and there are already 4 or 5 chunks of debris inside, mostly dust particles, but also something long and thin that I think is a cat hair or maybe a strand of spider silk. This crud isn't on the sensor or in the viewfinder, because I only see it in images shot with this lens, and not with my other lenses. So, be advised that you should avoid use of this lens anywhere that there is a lot of dust blowing around, for example like on a windy day or shooting pictures from your car window while driving on a dirt road.One other thought, now that I have had the lens for 15 months. I am not always pleased with the images it produces at max zoom. From 70mm to 200mm, I usually like what I get, but when I run it all the way out to 300mm, there is sometimes a color balance problem. It is as if I had put a mud colored filter over the lens. At first I thought the lens might just be causing some kind of under-exposure metering error in my camera, but even when I apply deliberate overexposure, the images still look muddy or hazy (and especially when there is even the slightest bit of backlighting in the scene). I almost always use the lens hood, so I don't think the issue is sun scattering off the coating, I think it must be something in the optics that just isn't performing optimally at that 300mm longest zoom. If I decide to retire this lens due to the dust contamination (see previous paragraph), I don't think I will buy another 70-300 zoom. I just haven't had much luck with them. I think I will try a 50-200 zoom and perhaps a 300mm internal-focus prime for when I need to shoot long distance. I have a friend who owns a Canon 50D and has an older (non-image-stabilized) Canon 300mm f2.8L lens for it. This lens is a monster, weighs about 10 pounds by itself I think, but egad, the images it produces are incredible! Now I know why professional and wildlife photographers I see in the field all seem to be shooting ""L"" series lenses if their camera is a Canon.I am downrating this lens review from 4 stars to three due to the dust and clarity issues. I guess you get what you pay for, and I now consider this lens to be only a little better than ""average"", hence only three stars, maybe 3-and-a-half."	1
267	Two very annoying problems...so annoying you should buy something else.	These speakers sound and look nice, but they have two very annoying problems. The first issue, which I've noticed from first use, is they are very susceptible to cell phone interference. Anytime my iPhone connects to the network (which is often), the speakers make a loud buzzing noise. Very annoying.The second issue, which has gotten progressively worse, is that the volume control knob has a mind of its own. As others mention in the reviews, you turn it up and the volume goes down. You just touch it and the volume goes up. Now the volume is going up and down without me even touching the knob. I've contacted Creative customer support, we'll see what they say.	1
268	Light weight, functional	Found this as a refurb elsewhere for almost 100 bucks less.Updated the RAM.  Easy enough and only 20 bucks to do.  Seriously people, don't pay someone to do this.  It's a piece of cake.  I also happened to have an extra 2 GB SD card floating around that I dropped in it and allowed it to use for RAM if need be.The touchpad is very sensitive, buy yourself a mouse.  The area where most people would rest their wrists will also affect the touch pad so be warned.  Thankfully there is enough tilt on it when it's sitting on something flat that it's not a deal breaker.  Might be for some tho.  The double touch scroll also doesn't work for me.Kept Windows Starter since there are tons of proggys out there to fill in the gaps with it. Haven't had any issues with that honestly.  Then again I'm not trying to turn it into my main workhorse either.Keyboard *sounds* cheap but feels ok. At first I was going to agree with the folks who said it felt cheap but the more I used it the more I realized it's the spring sound that throws you.  The keyboard itself it solid, but the spring sound gives the impression of a child's toy.Monitor is good, sound good for the size.WiFi works well but haven't used the Bluetooth any.Battery life has been good.  Watching movies it lasts 5-6 hours.  General surfing or word processing will probably give you at least 8.  Can't complain about that at all.I have to agree with the people who didn't like the charging port.  The male piece from the charging cord only sticks in part way.  It's a disaster waiting to happen IMO.Yes, it's going to move slower than your laptop or desktop.  It's supposed to.Got the Square Trade warranty from their site for cheaper than offered from the seller just in case.After reading a lot of reviews on netbooks, it seemed that most people who were unhappy with their netbook didn't really understand the concept of a netbook. No, this is likely not going to replace your more powerful laptop or desktop. But it does what I need it to do, so I'm good.	1
269	Dell lap top	I was looking for a good lap top for my son,and i searched around and I got this really great deal on this lap top,It works great,it fast and very user friendly!	0
270	Love it.	This unit is attached to he back of my 27: iMac.  I use it to handily my picture library.  Very fast.  Being a pessimist I back the disk up every night.	0
271	Great little mouse!	I have Windows 7 and it took no time to set this up.  The moment I connected the nano receiver, the mouse started working.The mouse itself is small and comfortable.  The cursor slides so nicely without bumping.  The wheel on top is so smooth and gentle.  The wheel can also be used to go back a page by tilting it to the left or forwards by tilting it to the right.  If you click down on the wheel, the link would be opened on a separate tab.  How handy!  And of course, the looks are really catchy.  I like it!	0

276	Very satisfied	The DS213 is my first NAS so I can't compare it to other systems.  The shipping was fast and well packaged.  I ordered two WD 3TB Red drives and they came in the same box as the DS213.  Installing the drives were simple.  Accessing the admin screens was easy too.  Then I become somewhat overwhelmed.  I purchased this strictly for reliable backups.  I didn't realize how much functionality came with the unit.  It's much more robust than I imagined.  I'm still learning and considering using more  features later.  For backups, I first tried JBOD to maximize my space, then then switched to RAID (SHR).  This setup was relatively easy.  Slightly confusing, but was just a few clicks once I knew what I was doing.  Now that I have it setup, it's been fast and reliable.  Unit will sleep when idle, but always wakes up when I access it.  Unit is quiet and drives stay very cool.  If the UI was a little simpler, I'd give it 5 stars.  If someday a disk crashes and I don't lose any data, I'll give it 5 stars no matter what I think about the UI.  That's what really matters to me.	0
277	Perfect	This is just what it was advertised to be and works great, I love it.  Easy to use and would definitely recommend.	0
278	nuvi 2450:  Not overly impressed	"I purchased the Garmin nuvi 2450 to replace an older model (nuvi 650 that I've had for about 3.5 years).  I figured I needed a maps update, and rather than spend $51 to update the 650 I thought I'd put the money towards an updated unit with a larger screen and more features.  I received the unit earlier today and have spent some time trying it out, and so far I'm not exactly thrilled with the purchase.First the good:- The 5"" screen is a big improvement over my old unit- The trip planning feature looks like it will be very useful- The 2450 has a powered mount, which is one of the reasons I purchased it over the 1450 (which requires you clip it into the mount *and* connect a separate power cable)- The speed limit notification works well on the major roads I tried it on, having the correct speed and switching over right about where the signs show a speed limit change- In general, navigation seems to be correct- Unlike my 650, the 2450 doesn't annoy you by saying ""recalculating"" endlessly when you don't take the turns it wants you to.  Instead it just starts giving you new instructions based on where you're at *now*, which I find far preferable.Now the not-so-good:- Immediately upon receiving the unit I updated it to the latest software version via Garmin's web site.  Once the new software has been downloaded to the unit, the web site instructs you to unplug the unit from your computer and wait for it to restart itself.  You're warned to be patient and not hit the power button until the unit has restarted itself as you could interfere with the update and make it unusable.  In my case, the unit appears to have shut down completely and did not restart itself despite a prolonged (over 10 minute) wait.  Finally I did press the power button and the unit then powered up and said it was updating the software.  When it finished I plugged it back into the computer as instructed and Garmin confirmed it was now running up-to-date software.- Compared to my old nuvi 650, the 2450 seems slow at calculating routes and looking up businesses.  Being ~4 years newer design than the 650 I expected it to be faster, not slower.- As it came from the factory, the unit lists local businesses that closed down some time ago (for example, it still lists an Italian restaurant that's been gone for three years or so).  It also couldn't seem to find a listing for a local business that's been at its current address for about eight years- It isn't up-to-date on local roads -- a sizable freeway overpass and connecting roads that opened about eight months ago aren't shown.- My first attempt to update the maps failed when the Garmin Map Update application crashed on my Mac (when over 75% of the way through downloading the update).  The updater apparently isn't smart enough to resume an interrupted download -- when restarted, it again started downloading the full 2350.7MB rather than being able to pick up where it left off.  As downloads take multiple hours, this is a major annoyance.  I'm still trying to download the latest maps to see if they improve some of the issues listed above.- Like my old 650, the language you choose for text can have unexpected consequences -- it affects more than just the spelling.  For instance, if you pick ""British English"" rather than ""American English"", then you're prompted for counties rather than States when traveling in the USA (so to enter an address in another State you have to select the option to enter a new ""county"" name and then type in the State name you want).I'm located in the suburbs of a major metropolitan area in the USA, so the out-of-date map data isn't because I'm way out in the boondocks somewhere.I'll update this review if getting the maps updated (assuming I'm successful at some point) improves things.  At the moment, though, I can't say I'm overly impressed with the 2450.UPDATE:  I successfully completed a maps update on the second try, as the Garmin Map Updater didn't crash this time.  Unfortunately, the behind-the-times issues mentioned above (restaurants closed for years still being listed; a large freeway overpass that opened last year isn't yet shown) are still there.  As one of the major reasons for purchasing a new unit was to get up-to-date maps and business listings, that's rather disappointing."	1
279	Nice for sharing	I've bought several of these as gifts for my kids, friends and grandmother.  It has good sound for a personal speaker, so is perfect for in a car, in a bedroom, or out on the porch.  The battery life is good, and the operation is simple.  I really like that I can share an audio book or my favorite tunes with folks around me.	0
280	It works!	I put it in the camera, and the camera turned on! This battery definitely works. If you need to turn on your camera without it being plugged into the wall or computer, than this one will do that. It's truly amazing. Provides energy!	0
281	Very good size and packing	A must have for averyone, its cheap and will do its job complete. The white reflector had a small punch but since i live overseas I can not return it but it was not a big deal. When I start using it will have to take this into account. Nice packing and easy carrying size.	0
282	Excellent purchase.	Excellent purchase. Needed to extend audio cable from my laptop to speaker set I got Cyber Acoustics Subwoofer Satellite System (CA-3602), which are AWESOME btw and it works great.	0
283	No more cords	Bought this for the office and we literally got it the next day. Assistant is over the moon, and when I went to Costco, almost feel over at the price.	0
284	Great Buy	Refurbished?The tablet seemed brand new to me. It did not come with the original box unfortunately. But, everything else is just fine!GREAT DEAL!GREAT PRODUCT!Very Happy Camper!	0
285	Nice gadget, bad software	The logger works as advertised but the accompanying software is badly conceived and implemented. Each picture must be selected (one cannot select a list with Ctrl-A), the button 'Display GPS Logs on Google Maps' doesn't work and generates a unending succession of error messages, it doesn't seem to be possible to locate more than a few pictures on a map, and so on...	1
286	Plug and go	As always, Crucial Technology came through with quality memory.. I just plugged them in and fired up the computer. What a nice difference. Thanks, Crucial.	0
287	Sansa Clip+	Does everything Sansa said it would. I am still learning all the functions but it sure beats the heck out of my old Walkman! Once I get it all figured out I feel sure it will perform very well. The sound is great & it is so small I never know it is hanging on my shirt pocket or on my arm. I love technology! Wouldn't it be great if they could get Bluetooth to work with the MP3 player so we could eliminate the headset cord.......or have they already done that & I am just not aware of it yet?	0
288	Great Speaker, really impressed!	I was very skeptical about this when i got it as a gift, read some negative reviews on other sites and didnt expect much. Wow was I wrong! this thing has really great bass (which was the negative on other similar items) and pretty good reception. Get one, I love it. I hooked it up to my TV Receiver and anything that comes out of it, comes out of the Wireless speaker. i cant say enough about it - what a pleasant surprise!	0
289	Wonderful Story	This dvd is not only good around Christmas time, it is a wonderful movie all year long. Children enjoy this all the time. They love to believe in the magic of christmas all year long. What a wonderful story for them to watch.	0
290	Quite handy, too bright	This SSD rack is super-convenient and works perfectly!  The plastic is a bit cheap feeling, but it's thick and sturdy. The only major complaint I have is the ridiculously bright LED they use for HDD activity- it is horrible.  Fixed with a bit of electrical tape, but seriously? Why does it require an LED? And why does the LED need to be so freaking bright?	1
291	JUST OK	"1. The tilting has to be done before you hang it, otherwise, when the bottom screws are in place, it is also impossible because the gap between the mount and the TV is too small/narrow making hands not able to reach.  2. If your mounting position is mark correctly, you should not do very much of left and right adjustment, or the length is kind of short that does not allow you to slide left and right much.  3. The mount is not as strong as my old one, however, LED TV 55"" weighs less than 70 lbs that makes it acceptable. 4. Bottom screws require a 12"" long screw driver to tighten."	1
292	As advertised	THis case fits well and looks good. My son wanted something like this and is quite satisfied with this one.	0
293	Average value and performance	For $30 you get what you pay for.  I got this because I bought a head unti that could accept it and thought it would be a novelty.  I have a big long truck with tinted rear windows so it certainly couldn't hurt to have a camera back there, but it wasn't a necessity.  Which is a good thing because with this camera, that's about all it's good for.First, the picture quality is just OK.  It's not very clear even in bright light.  Surprisingly the quality is about the same in the dark so the night vision works well, it's just not a high quality picture.  More importantly, the angle is not nearly wide enough.  I drove a rental Lincoln Navigator with a backup cam that I swear could see more than 180 degrees.  It also was mounted high enough that coupled with the wide angle you could actually see the bumper in the bottom of the screen.  With this camera (mine is mounted just above my bumper) I definitely can't see any part of the truck, and I can't see anything near either corner either.  Only directly behind me, so using the side mirrors in conjunction is mandatory (not that you should only use the camera anyway but...).The camera and its housing are slightly large. Yes it's intended to go on a license plate, although I feel this isn't terribly secure from thieves.  But it's not inconspicuous at all.  You see it from a mile away approaching the truck, so don't hope for a stealth install.Last but not least, and this is mostly a mounting issue, but in the rain this thing is 100% worthless.  I even mounted under a lip hoping it would stay a bit more dry but it didn't help.  Anyway, when wet you can't see anything at all.Not bad for just a basic cam, but don't expect much more.	1
294	Sony MDR R1	These are a very solid pair of headphones.Pros:-Low impedance, so they can be driven by pretty much anything. Smartphones will have no problem.-Sound is very good, highs and mids are very clear and there is a good tight bass response but not excessive bass.-Very stylish, and very comfortable.-There are two cables included, one with inline controls, one without.-The cables are of good quality.-Detachable cable so you can easily replace it.-Very comfortable, the headband and ear cup material has a soft memory foam material in them and the covering is very soft and supple.Cons:-Ear cups are not replaceable! At least I don't see a way to remove them. So longevity is a question. This is strange because these seem to be geared towards mobile use, which to me increases wear and tear.-Materials do not match the price. The cups are made of a metal (aluminum?), but the rest is plastic. The ear cup material  and headband material are a synthetic material.-The jack that attaches the cable to the phones concerns me, it is very loose and I question it's durability.Con or a Pro, depending on how you look at it:-Not neutral, these definitely have some boom (not too much, but it is noticeable).-Right angle jack, awesome for mobile, kind of awkward at home.-A somewhat loose fit. Very comfortable for at home use, but no so good when walking around.-The cable is rather short for home use, which is a pro for mobile use (long cords are a pain a pain when commuting). Sony should have included a longer cable for use at home.Overall I am happy with these headphones, I like what Sony is doing lately with their headphone lines.	1
295	Couplers.	These couple coax lines together.  Not much more to it, they do what they were intended to do. Good stuff	0
296	Just right for the money	This is a great product for the money. Worked great, easy to install. The screen lit up with no problem, it works just fine.	0
297	Simple, superb	At least splitting out a Mac network this is as simple and as good as it gets - literally plug and play.  No discernible network lag no matter how slow the slowest connected device. Appears to appropriately sense and set speed for each connected device. FYI this replaced the slightly higher priced Pro product which mysteriously died after only two year of continuous use (although worked fine during that period).	0
298	best Garmin of the past 2-3 years	"upd/04/25: most of this review gets outdated as old issues get fixed, which is good. What is not so good is that routing (with TrafficTrends on) became way too conservative. At nighttime on local streets it's not uncommon for for the unit to give a 20-minute estimate on a 12 minute route. It looks as if the ""trends"" are not granular enough to separate day and night. Time estimate is also very conservative on highways. I am not an aggresive driver, but  even for me highway travel times are way too pessimistic.  HD traffic coverage is still virtually non-existent  outside of NYC and few other areas. Just to give an example, there is no traffic coverage pretty much anywhere on I-87 from NYC to Canadian border.  To be fair, things are much better on I-91 in Connecticut and quite good in NYC.All in all, after using 3490 for >6 months now I am still holding  to my initial opinion: this is is the best thing Garmin has done since 25x and 75x series since everything in between was just a sad joke.  On the other hand, I still find that those older models do a better job in many situation and the software is definitely way more stable on older units. Other than that, 3490 is cool and fun, unless you want to sacrifice some screen resolution but get a bigger screen with 2595upd 01/18: it looks like after 3 months of delay, ""Unable to calculate route"" error was finally fixed with firmware version 4.4.Also this update introduced something called ""smartphone link"".According to description, it connects to Android phones and brings Live traffic for $20/year and fuel prices for $10/year. Tried it once so far - very easy to set up, just have to download the app and connect via bluetooth. Traffic data seemed to different from what is coming through HD and showed a some highways as closed while they were not. One annoying ""feature"" is that when smartphone link is in use, all calls are forwarded to the Nuvi, which is sort of redundant.The rest is the review as of November.""Best Garmin"" doesn't mean perfect.  It's a new model, so bugs are visible every day. It fails to calculate pretty much every route from Brooklyn to Manhattan due to (what it seems to be) a mapping bug on one of the highways. So I have to drive up to the critical point and navigate from there. I've seen people having similar problem in other  parts of the country and this also is an issue with other models from the new line-up (tested on 2495). My expectation is that this will be fixed soon as it's not really acceptable. Upd: as I've said - fixed in firmware v 4.4Update to 3.6 also introduced a curious bug where the unit occasionally reboots itself if I miss a turn.I also had problems registering it because Garmin communicator plug-in couldn't see it on my PC. If you have the same problem, it should be easily solvable, see comments to this post.Sometimes it also restarts during voice recognition. No big deal, really.Map detail is still inadequate. In 2D view most highways will not be labeled, which makes selecting a point on map a very painful, if not impossible task. Old pre 1xxx Garmins have better map detail and  I still much prefer 255W for long-distance drives. Especially given that it has better traffic coverage.That said, I actually like 3490 way more then I expected and I think it's a great unit.  The UI has been re-worked and simplified  compared to the chaotic mess that Garmin has been doing for the last 2-3 years. It's almost as easy to use as old Nuvi's from 200, 600 and 700 series, but has a much richer functionality. (Ok, the UI might not be immediately straightforward and I had to explain customer service rep how to turn GPS simulation mode on, but once you get used to it, it feels great and gets better with time)One of the best features of 3490 is the ease of input. You don't have to suffer through entering the state and the city anymore. Just type the street and the house number and it will search for the address in nearby cities and states, will give you a list of choices , and only if you don't see the one you're looking for, you can type the city and state. For someone who has to commute between two states (like NY and NJ) that would be a nice relief. Also, while you type, it offers several matching street names to choose from. The only strange thing is that the matches don't seem to depend on your prior searches, e.g. if you recently searched for ""Broadway"" and start typing ""B"", you'll have to type all the way until ""Broadw"" before ""Broadway"" shows up. TomTom (I own 2535) would give it right away.POI search is also simplified  (even though it's hard to imagine that POI search on Garmin can be made simpler). Many weird GUI solutions made in earlier versions are now re-worked into something that gives you a very pleasant experience. POI categories are even more clearly defined, restaurant types have even more sub-categories and you can also search POI by simply typing (or saying) the name.  Also what's important, POI search is very fast, great improvement compared to older versions.You still have an option to choose ""poi near destination"", ""poi near active route"", etc, and selecting those options  is also much easier than on units released in the last couple of years. ""Poi near active route"" option was re-worked and it feels like it's integrated  with the new ""exit services"" feature. If in the past you would get a list of,  hotels, with distance, now it would group them by highway name and  exit number and for the nearest ones will give the distance to the exit too.  I have to note here that I had at least one case where with all the bells and whistles and the new UI, the closest gas station it could offer  along the route was 10 miles away and required additional 10 minutes of travel time, while my pre-historic 255W with same map version offered a gas station that was 1 mile away and required a 2-minute detour.Another item that was re-worked significantly is  adding a via point. It now seems to be integrated with  trip planner, so when you try to add a new point to your route, you can re-shuffle the order of destinations. The downside of it, as some people complained, is that if you browse a map, it might only show you the first leg of the route (as always, not clear why). This doesn't seem to be a big issue and if while planning you select ""routes"" you will be able to see the whole route on map during the planning stage.Speaking of this, yet another awesome feature of 3490 is that  it offers you several routes to your destination and you can pick the one you like. Not just ""route A, route B"" as it showed up on 3790 and others, but more like Google maps or Navigon. A grain of salt is that when displayed on the map, the colors for alternative routes do not take into account current map scheme, so in some color schemes they are pretty much invisible  as their color may be very similar to the colors of highways and interstates. There is also no way to see the alternatives in text format.Now, the most important piece - the routing. They made really a quantum leap and a great break-through there. For the last 3 or 4 years Garmin was way behind TomTom  in terms of navigation in big cities and failed to account for historically congested roads and delays due to traffic lights. Last year Garmin rolled out TrafficTrends as a response to TomTom's IQRoutes. It's been a complete disaster as you can read in multiple reviews.  After all this time I was surprised to see that TrafficTrends actually do work on 3490. The estimated arrival time and routes in NYC have been  improved dramatically. I am driving with 3490 alongside TomTom 2535 LIVE and I can't really say that one unit is much better than the other. It's pretty much a tie where TomTom probably maintains  slight lead. Route calculation times on Garmin are not bad, but recalculation while driving is sometimes much slower than on TomTom. There may be situation when recalculation takes a while. It's mildly annoying as you might miss an exit or a turn, but  doesn't happen too often.Just to give you some idea how the routing works in NYS.On my test routes that includes Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn I've got1) estimated  35 min,  actual driving time  - 452) estimated  28 min,  actual driving time  - 43 (7 minutes unreported bridge traffic + 6 minutes traffic lights)3) estimated  36 min,  actual driving time - 414) estimated  17 min,  actual driving time 15.This timing is with enabled TrafficTrends (TrafficTrends are by default disabled on this unit)Traffic.  I see a lot of people complaining about it.  In New York  and around the city everything works pretty well. There doesn't seem to be much traffic signal out of the city and when I approach a city  it seems to get the signal later than either TomTom or my old Garmin. Outside of NYC I've seen virtually no traffic coverage on this unit. Haven't gone far enough, at most 6-7 hour drives. Regular FM does a much better job.On a positive side, in the city traffic acquisition is immediate, thanks to HD radio traffic. Feels almost like Live units, but requires a cable to be plugged in.Of course, initial acquisition is only  a part of the picture and mostly matters when you start driving. While on your way, it doesn't matter too much if update frequency is 30 sec or 2-3 min like on devices with FM receivers. What matters more is the quality of information your traffic provider gives you. I've seen a case when TomTom's HD Traffic correctly indicated that there is an 8-minute traffic on a local street in Manhattan while 3490 tried to route through this street. I've also seen my old 255W (with double Navteq + TTN subscription) showing a better highway traffic coverage. And of course I had a few chances to spend 20-40 minutes in traffic that none of my units had any idea about. Overall, I am happy with the traffic info I get on this unit on NYC streets (not talking about out of town) and think it's pretty much on par with TomTom's HDVoice recognition works like a charm and ""wake up"" phrase to activate voice recognition is a cool feature present on Garmins and absent on TomToms. I never really cared about voice recognition and normally would play with it a couple of times and forget forever. On 3490 I actually use it, even for things like adjusting screen brightness.Advanced detours, introduced in 24xx series are also available on 3490 (and also disabled by default). Seems to work well. In general, implementation is a bit less user friendly than on TomTom, like when you would try to avoid a road by street name, it has a tendency to get too detailed and show you every ramp, so that on complex interchanges it becomes nearly impossible to figure out what needs to be selected. Other than that, it's a very welcome addition that was missing on Garmin for a long time. They also have an option to avoid any square region on map. I tried to use it to block block a permanently closed exit near Lincoln Tunnel in Manhattan. It ended up blocking the whole block that included the whole avenue, which was absolutely not what I was looking for.Screen - high resolution, bright, multi-touch, dual-orientation and all other bells and whistles. Very good.Finally,  few  things that disappoint me. Some are a matter of personal taste, so may be minor for most people.Speed  indicator  turns red as soon as you exceed speed limit by 1 mile. In night color mode red on gray is difficult to read as there is not enough contrast between the two colors, especially when you try to look at it from a 5ft distance.  It's really stressing my eyes and it clearly would take a developer like 30 seconds to slightly modify the colors. I complained before in earlier versions, but still no change.Sound quality is not the best you can find. The device is very thin, so it's probably hard to squeeze in  a decent speaker. This is not a big issue, just it's very noticeable if you run it side-by-side with a bulkier gps unit. Also, the generated voice that speaks street names sounds too robotic compared to TomTom's.Map rendering is sometimes slow. Looking at 2D map at large scale is nearly impossible as the unit goes into sleep mode before it actually manages to render the map. Sometimes it is also noticeable while driving and parts of the screen my get black for some time. To me it's not really a a big issue and is not nearly as irritating as the speed limit thing.When viewed on a large scale, the map would mostly show the grid of highways with no labels. On long-distance trips it makes zooming-out on the map effectively useless. It comes nowhere close to 2D map display that was available on pre-1000 units. Yeah, it looks better on 3490, but it gives you less information and I am not happy with this trade-off.Initially I was also stupid enough to complain about screen been overloaded with useless buttons. This is easily fixable, see comments.Not a drawback of this specific unit, but it's anyway sad that the device is not connected. Features like live speed cameras or gas prices or weather radar are nice to have and something one gets used to very quickly. Also, I would strongly prefer a 5-inch device, but for some reason they don't produce 5-inch higher-end units. Looks strange to me as I don't really care if it's thin and light. After the excitement of the first few days is gone and the unit is installed in the car, thickness doesn't really matter, but screen size does.Overall,  I like this unit. It seems to be good enough or almost good enough to make  TomTom non-critical for driving on NYC streets. It also has a much friendlier UI that's almost as easy to use as the one on my old 255. Taking into account map details, I still think 255 and other ancient  Garmins are  better choices for long-distance trips, but 3490 comes pretty close. And their implementation of lane assist is just great.The biggest problem for me now is ""unable to calculate route"" issue as it affects pretty much every route I have to take (up until I cross some critical point on that highway). Other than that, it feels almost like the spirit of good old user-friendly Garmin is back. If only they fixed map details and speed indicator..."	1
299	Solid switch, almost perfect for in-closet/project box installations	I got this switch to mount in an in-closet utility box, specifically because of its small size.  The switch itself meets my specifications, but the power adapter is much larger than anticipated, maybe 40% the size of the switch.  It required some creative re-arranging to get that to fit, while the switch fit perfectly.The switch itself is great, providing reliable and fast switching in a tiny form factor, with low power consumption and no fans.	1
300	Working with Sony A7 & A7R with MI Shoe	After trying numerous small size flashes from here on Amazon, I finally had to get the official Sony one for my new Sony A7R.Previously ordered small flashes and tried with the Sony A7R:Bower SFD450C Digital e-TTL II Dedicated Autofocus Illuminator for Canon XT/XS/30D/60D/T2i/T3/T5i/1D/5D Mark III/6D/7D/SL1 and Similar DSLRs (Black)Sunpak RD2000C Camera FlashI was looking for just a simple small flash to fit on the tiny A7R body and both the Bower and Sunpak delivered on the size but not the functionality. The Sony HVLF 20M lacks any sort of manual controls on the flash (what I really wanted) but is compatible with the new A7R's MI shoe and isn't overly bulky. I've used a Yongnuo 560 II flash and a true Canon 600 EX-RT and both work fine in the hot shoe - they're just as big as the Sony A7R camera is itself.The HVLF 20M with the MI designation works in Sony's new Multi-Interface shoe which is on the A7R, and while limited in functions it at least provides a good compact flash solution. You can only use the flash in Direct or Bounce mode, which just tilts the flash head slightly upwards to not be quite as harsh. If the head swiveled this would be a perfect flash but alas you just have a slightly better than pop-up flash solution for over a hundred dollars... thanks Sony. The flash is not really that powerful at all, it only runs on 2x AAA batteries which saves the weight and size but sacrifices the power output to GN 20 (about half power of a full power flash like the Canon 600 EX-RT which most websites cite as GN 60 though this is a moving value based on flash zoom and bounce).Overall happy to finally have some sort of flash for the A7R. Wish it had a rotating flash head for the price but it's better than nothing.	1
301	Does not fit well.. you get for wat u pay	This headset is usable but does not stay on ur ears. you wud perhaps need a sponge cover for the earphone.	1
302	MDR-IF540RK	I'll try not to repeat previous comments.Chunky, heavy headphone but comfortable for long-term use. I have two of this, on one unit the charge light stay on indicating the batteries not fully charged on either headset even when both units are fully charged. You could use two headsets at the same time with one transmitter but when one headset is charging the respective transmitter is disabled.Nice clean full body sound when within the range of the transmitter, as good as my electret headphone. My problem with the MDR-IF540RKs is when close to a computer, sitting on a massage chair or walking on a treadmill, the interference from other electrical or electronic systems is horrible. So the sound could be excellent to unrecognizable dependent of the headphone orientation and proximity to other electrical devices.	1
303	Great charger	works great, has a nice sturdy feel to it. I've seen some reviews saying it feels cheap but I've dropped mine and thrown it around the car for quite a while now. It's holding up great, still charges just fine and everything.I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. I've bought a few for all the cars and for my parents.	0
304	It's Nicer than a bunch of cables!!	This is a great way to go if your equipment as it. It sounds great but the best part is how thin the cable is. It nice to have.	0
305	"Great GPS, nice to get the ""stuff"" with it!"	I knew as soon as I tried this unit that it was a keeper. The other two that I had tried in the past failed a critical test by not accurately getting me to work. This one did! My office is located in a spot where Google maps, the two previous GPS units I tried, and other such devices & services, tend to send people to the wrong side of a very difficult intersection. Can't wait to test this one even more! The fact that it comes with mounts and chargers makes it even better, because it saves time and trouble in having to order it all separately. I'm very happy with my purchase so far!	0
306	Stylish Bag	This bag worked as advertised. It housed my D7000 & 2 Lens plus my iPad. It looks professional & practical. It stayed on my shoulder with no problem. The handle also functions well. A nice touch. Would gladly recommend to friends.	0
307	Fits well	This case fits the ipad air well and seems to do a good job in protecting it.I just wish the grooves on the stand part of it were a little deeper.It doesn't take much to knock it down during use, especially in portrait mode.	1
308	Does the job but not as sturdy as expected	I purchased this lens hood for my Canon T4i w/ 18-135mm STM kit lens.  I was originally going to use a UV filter to protect my lens but was advised by others to instead use a lens hood to avoid adding another piece of glass in the optical path. A lens hood will avoid sun flaring in your pictures while also providing some protection for lens from bumps, etc.I opted for the Canon EW-73B lens hood since it wasn't really that much more expensive than the &#34;knock-offs&#34; (just $21.50).  I'd also read reviews that the Canon version was higher quality (velvet interior surface) and a better fit than the cheaper versions. The Canon EW-73B delivers on all of those promisses - the interior surface is very smooth and seems very well-contructed, and the fit is absolutely perfect - snaps very nicely into place.The only disappointment (and only reason this isn't a 5-star review) is that the plastic seems a bit flimsy.  I can very easily compress the hood by gently squeezing the sides.  As a result, I can tell it certainly won't protect my lens from a fall of more than 6 inches.  The protection benefit will apply only to fairly gentle bumps.  Just something to keep in mind, but I'm very happy with this purchase.	1
309	Ugly but pretty functional.	This case is a bit bulky and fairly ugly.  But I feel it partially resolves a big limitation of the Surface Pro, which is the poor lap performance.  The built in stand of the surface is good for putting on a desk, but is very poor using it as a laptop, especially the way I use it.  I don't use a Type/Touch cover.  I use a Lenovo Thinkpad Bluetooth keyboard with Trackpoint.  The keyboard works great with my Surface Pro, but I was having trouble using it in my lap, especially as the passenger in a car.I use it primarily with the little snap on cover that doubles as a stand.  it has three little ridges that allow you to adjust the angle.  It turns out that the little lip left over is perfect for resting my keyboard.  As a bonus, resting the keyboard here stabilizes the whole thing and allows me to work effectively in the car.So while I can't say I'm thrilled with the looks/fit (I wasn't expecting much from something at this price point), I find the function to be excellent.  The stylus loop is there and works OK.  It is a bit tricky to get in and out, especially in poor light, but it is better than trying to put it in the power port.	1
310	The Best	This is the best SDHC card I've ever owned. It has a guarantee of minimum transfer rates. show me another company that does that!!Get one, you'll be glad you did.	0
311	Total Nonsense! It's been malfuntioning from very first day!	What a disappoinment!I like Magellan RoadMate 5045-LM 5-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator user friendly interface.However, It's been malfuntionin from the very first day of operation.First day, It was displaying wrong side street names but I thounght that was temporary.After using about two weeks, this device has gone to out of control whis is not showing side street names except major street names.I was informed that magellan GPS has been changed to TELE ATLAS MAPS from NAVTEQI should be careful about that warning!I am returning this unit because this unit no longer shows side street names except major street names JUST IN TWO WEEKS OF PURCHASE!Very disappoited!	1
312	A nice unit that I would recommend.	I've owned this for almost 3 months and am very happy with it.  The 4 backup/surge and 5 surge only outlets are more than adequate for my needs.  Input/output voltages, battery charge, etc. can be accessed through the LCD screen or the software that's included.  The software also allows you to schedule when the system will turn on/off as well as several other things.  The only negative I found is that the outlet spacing doesn't accomodate power supplies.  I got around this by buying some  power cord extenders.  All in all a nice unit that I would recommend.	1
313	After 2 years of use review	Have used it for a couple of years now and can safely say it is very reliable and sturdy. It has been in my backpack all this time which gets rattled a lot. Access speeds are very good too.	0
314	Low profile is a huge plus	I've had accidents that left USB ports in my laptops only semi usable so the form factor was the major consideration for purchasing this adapter. This tiny adapter hugs the laptop so closely that it's virtually impossible bump it or knock it out of the port. I use Linux so I can't evaluate the wizard software. I had no problem connecting to an Edimax DSL modem. I would expecft it to work equally well with Netgear and Zoom but I haven't tested those combinations yet.Likes: sizeDislikes: haven't found a way for it to coexist with existing B/G hadware (yet)	1
315	Nice features, but mine hang too often.	The title says most of it. I bought two of these almost two years ago, one for work and one for home. I primarily used them to connect a keyboard and mouse to a Lenovo Laptop. From day one I had problems with the hub seemingly going dead - the key board or mouse would just quit in mid-click. We had 6 of these Lenovos at work, and our, since we build USB devices we quickly discovered the Lenovos were slightly off the USB spec in several ways. This made me cut the hub some slack, even though my USB devices did work better when attached directly to the Lenovo.A few weeks ago the Lenovo died and I replaced it with an Asus. To my annoyance, both my hubs still go dead. I'm off to the store now to try some other brand.Except for the dying thing these hubs are not bad. The purple light is pretty with the silver finish, and the price was OK. The Power brick is quite weak - trying to charge my phone takes 3x longer on the hub than with the phone's charger. I would not try to run a USB hard drive through this hub.I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because both hubs are still (almost) working after 2 years. That's better than a lot of cheap electronics these days.	1
316	mini softbox	I use a speedlight on a stick using the Fong Snoot and cloud dome as a mini softbox to add just a bump of light. It works well.	0
317	Great Case	This case is perfect for my kindle and keeps it protected when I want to throw it in my purse or backpack. Good quality product.	0
318	Ultimate Universal Notebook Charger by Emerge Technologies!	"I was a little skeptical when deciding wether or not I wanted to try this product when it was offered to me through the Vine Program.  There were so many negative reviews or reasons why it didn't work, different models it would work with and one review specified Sony, which is the type of laptop I own.  We actually own TWO Sony Vaio laptops and when my charger went last month, I was surprised to find out that it would cost me almost $80.00 to replace it with a genunie Sony part.I'm more than happy that I took the chance.  This gives new meaning to the word ""Universal"" and I have to say that I can't agree with the other reviews that claim it doesn't work with a Sony or Dell or HP.  The fact of the matter is, it works with all three. How do I know? I tried these adaptor tips on our two Sony laptops, our parent's HP and our friend's Dell. ALL fit perfectly!  Each piece had a snug fit and connected tightly to the other, but not too tight that I couldn't interchange them with ease.The next thing I love is the retractable cord.  You give it a slight tug and it goes in, pull it out to the desired length, stop and there it stays! I couldn't be more pleased with the results of this product!So, before you spend anywhere from $60.00 to $100.00 for a genuine part, I highly recommend this sturdy, compact and lightweight cord. It does the job and has continued to work with my laptop since I took it out of the package.Oh and it comes with a really nice black bag to put the charger and adaptors in when it is not in use! A value for the quality of the product! I hope you have the luck that I did. Sony users don't be afraid to purchase this charger! It worked with the two different Sony Vaio notebooks that we have! As I was just now reading some of these reviews, I couldn't believe we received the same product."	0
319	Terrific New Mouse from Microsoft	"Microsoft's new Sculpt Touch Mouse is a terrific product.  I am normally an Apple product user, but I was struck by what a great product I found in this mouse.Firstly, the bluetooth functionality worked with all my Macs I tested it on as well as a Dell notebook I tested it on.  Now, you won't want to move it between computers probably because un-pairing is always a hassle with these devices, but it should work on just about any bluetooth compatible computer right out of the carton.  You will need bluetooth capability in your computer because the mouse does not come with a dongle for the computer.Once you're up and running, both under Windows and Mac, the mouse works great.The mouse solves the problem of a roller ball or scroll that can get gummed up and cause trouble down the line.  This uses a virtual scroller. However, it gives you ""feedback.""  You can feel something rolling inside the mouse, so while a physical wheel is not moving on the exterior, you still get that valuable feedback of ""feeling,"" the scroll, to make your computer use more comfortable and predictable.The size of the mouse is quite small and has a great shape.  I could have used the mouse being just slightly larger for my hand.However, overall, this is a terrific product.  Well done Microsoft!  Oh, one more bonus, it takes AA batteries or AA rechargeable batteries so you don't have to worry about plugging the mouse in when it goes dead."	0
320	kinda works ok......	Probably better to just pay more and get something of a higher quality. The one I received came with a power chord or connection didn't work, so I had to open up the computer and plug in the drive that way anyways.	1
321	Bad TCL support	My TV came with missing screws. I contacted TCL support to see if they can send me the missing screws. I was told to call a second number with a case number, but the people at the second number haven't picked up.Edit:If someone can tell me the screws needed for the TV, I could just buy them at a hardware store, but this information seems to be impossible to find.	1
322	Price is right, just check your configuration first!	Black powder coated metal disk drive adapter? Check. Good construction? Check. Excellent price? Check!What's not to love? You can only mount your SSD from the bottom screws and not the sides. That means that if you need your SSD &#34;suspended&#34; above the adapter plate this one won't work for you.It turns out that I couldn't use this adapter in my configuration for that reason (got a Silverstone Tek instead) but that's not to say this is a bad adapter. On the contrary, it's very ruggedly built and I suspect that it would look good in a transparent case as well, if you are in to those sort of things.Overall, I like it and I won't be returning it - I know I'll have a use for this adapter in some future installation. :)	0
323	Great if you have a super quiet car	This was really easy to set up and connect to my LG phone.  Unfortunately, I have a 2004 Honda Element and that's an SUV where you really hear the road noise, especially at 40 mph and faster.  I can hear the speaker okay if I listen closely, but the person on the other end of the call can hear the road noise and they'll have trouble hearing me.  Also, the visor in this SUV is farther away from me compared to when I'm in a sedan, and that adds to the problem, the mic is too far from me.  In this vehicle, I can't use this speaker phone - and I think that if you have a car where the road noise isn't a problem but you often have the heat or air conditioning on full blast, it'll be a problem then too.  I'm waffling between 3 and 4 stars for this product, but I think background noise is a problem of the car and I don't know what a speaker phone could do to minimize it on the other end of the call.For the right car where there's not too much background noise and the visor lets the mic be closer to you, this is a nice option.  However, it isn't for me.	1
324	Great solution for HP touchpad...Works with touchstone charger...	Great fit for an HP touchpad.  Works with the touchstone charger with no problems.  This is a great deal for the price.  It looks nice and feels good.  Has built in magnets and a snap to keep it closed.  The stand works well and has a variety of angles.  It does add a bit of thickness to the touchpad but it is a fair trade off for a little protection.	0
325	No email support for Gmail/Ymail. Requires DNS or hosting for most other functions.	I bought this on deal so I bought 2.  I have an Ethernet Pan/Tilt camera but thought these would be cool to Place away from my router. Instructions are poor and I admit I did not call the 24/7 support just because a little look on Trendnet website answered my questions and these don't fit my needs. I could not recommend this unless someone knows exactly what it will and will not do.  I'm dumb and not super tech savvy so here we goPros.1. Works to View from PC on your home network.2. If you already have a server, DNS and compatible email account it is a good price point.3. 36 month warranty. IDK about service though could be life saver or worthless...4. CheapCons1.Does not support free webmail. No Gmail or Ymail. If you know a free reputable webmail service that works with these please say so in comments.2.Requires paid DNS service and a host server to view from outside your home network. Again if I am wrong let me know. I don't' even know what this is. I'm dumb.3.Android app is poor and has never seen an update. Seems to be abandoned. Also requires hosting.4.Requires ethernet cord for setup but does not include one.5.Camera gets and stays hot. Probably a bit of a juice hog to run 24/7.	1
326	Ingenious Product	What can one say about an ingenious product from a top innovating camera maker company like Canon. It is not nice to go repeat the features of it but now I carry it with me almost in my pocket wherever I go. Clear HD pics and vids, blue tooth connection - even though I haven't used it yet to direct print or transfer data into my computer, an ELPH 1000 stayed with me for years and I expect this one to continue for the years to come	0
327	Inexpensive and has good features	"I purchased a 2013 13"" MacBook Air.  I spent a good chunk of money on this laptop and and would like to keep it for five years.  I did not have any sleeve for the macbook that work provided me.  It got kind of beat up.  It would fly off the seat of my car if I stopped in a hurry.  And I dented the corner when a cheap messenger bag strap broke and it hit the ground from waist high.  So I decided I really should have a sleeve that would serve multiple purposes: cushiony in case I drop it, and non-metal and grippy to prevent sliding and/or slipping out of my hands.  The zipper feels like it is metal but it is doesn't have sharp edges; it is dipped in paint.  And there is a foam bead on the inside of the top to keep the zipper from touching the laptop.  All in all I am very happy with this sleeve.  No frills and priced right.  It deserves to be a #1 seller."	0
328	Great Deal	Great deal and with the Prime shipping it was a real steal for under $20. Just plugged it in and the computer saw it automatically brought up the registration screen... filled it out and then popped in a dvd... so slick	0
329	Very good HTPC keyboard/touchpad	"The SMK-Link Wireless Ultra-mini Touchpad Keyboard (long name for a small keyboard), is a well made, great sized, and generally very functional keyboard/touchpad that is very good for HTPC use.The keypad measures 5.25"" x 3.7"" x 1.3"" and weighs &lt;7 oz with batteries. The touchpad area is about 1.7""w x 1.3""h. The device is well balanced, since one AA battery goes into each side via slide-open doors on the bottom. There is a sort of bulge on the bottom left and right that make nice hand grips. However, it makes the unit difficult to balance on the arm of my futon. A sofa with wider, upholstered arms would likely not have this issue. To the left of the touchpad is a directional pad that, with a Function key, also provides PG UP/DN, HOME, and END functions. To the right of the touchpad is a keypad that provides PLAY/PAUSE, JUMP FWD/BK, and STOP functions. A full keyboard (minus F1-F12) takes up the bottom half of the top face, with handy Vol. UP/DOWN and Mute keys. The numeric keys have alternate functions when the orange Function key is pressed. Mouse buttons are located where trigger buttons on a game controller would be found.Here are some pros and cons I observed while using this keyboard/remote with my home-built HTPC daily for the past month.PROS:Nice balance. The battery on each side gives the keyboard a nice balanced feel.Has all the keys I ever use, and a Function key provides alternate uses for some keys. I don't ever use F1-F12 on my HTPC, so the omission isn't a problem for me, but it might be for other people.Trackpad has a great smooth operation. There is no separate driver for this keyboard, so the built-in Windows 7 driver provides all that buttery smoothness of motion.Love the location and functions of the keypads straddling the touchpad. I have another HTPC remote that lacks a STOP button, which is its main weakness, but this SMK-LINK has STOP, and I love it.Great range. All my other keyboard/remotes for the HTPC are marginal at 12 ft., but this one operated a floor away and across the room. Killer performance.LEDs for Caps Lock and Function lock.Storage dock for USB dongle.CONS:No tap to click. This drove me a little crazy. I use laptops regularly, and you can always tap on them for mouse click. I couldn't get taps on this touchpad to register. If anyone else has been able to do so, please post a comment on the review and let me know how to do it. Anyway, the left and right mouse buttons are easy to use, but even after a month, I still want to tap that darn trackpad. I always do it, then proceed to click the mouse button.Keys are a bit too stiff. Only a little bit. It makes typing a bit error-prone for me. I have tiny hands, so the tiny keys were not a problem for me, but if you have large man hands, you may have some trouble typing accurately (just like with a smartphone keyboard). Another household user found the key stiffness to give a ""just right"" resistance that helped reduce errors.Touchpad is a bit small. Because of its sensitivity, it still lets you navigate the screen pretty easily, though a 55"" screen takes several full swipes to get from top to bottom. It also makes using multi-touch gestures (like pinch) difficult."	1
330	Works great but plastic wire holder broke	This Surge Protector works great. The only problem is the wire holder at the ends that holds the cords. It broke after plugging in the third wire. I decided to live with the problem since it works but I would have liked it to have remained intact.	1
331	Very Good!!	I was trying to check for something to try on my new Lenovo laptop which don't know why came back from service center with advices that In-built intel centrio 2230 wifi unit might now wok well with my belkin router.Even though the box does not say support for windows 8 (I ordered it as unable to find it online), it work very well out of the box on Windows 8.Solved my problem.	0
332	Great Replacement!	It works perfectly with my Sony Bravia flatscreen TV. It's a duplicate of the original. Good buy too. X X	0
333	Excelente	Este es un muy buen producto, funciona muy bien en reuniones con mucha gente, la calidad de sonido es muy buena, no consume muchas baterias. mur recomendable	0
334	One Sheet	I bought this product and  a Tech Armor Iphone of a friend, I set the sheet on the screen around January and the protection still looks like it is working well. Beside this, I want to add the customer service works amazing, I contact them regarding an issue with the Tech Armor for Iphone and they sent me a replacement of their product right away (2 business day). It is great to buy from this company with exceptional customer service culture.	0
335	It is pretty good.	My 05 CRV has a CD and a tape player, but no audio in.  I thought about purchasing a radio transmitter to compensate this problem so that I can play music from my phone.  Well, radio frequency always gets interfered by other frequencies and I really really dislike the quality. This is the first time I've ever used a tape adapter. It simply exceeds my expectation... the sound is stunning for me (maybe it's b/c I was so sick of the FM transmitter).  Most of my mp3 files are at 320 kbps (as opposed to the CD files that are at 800 kbps minimum).  I could hear no difference.  There might be some statics if you turn the speakers up; however, I am really really glad with this alternative.	1
336	Ok but less storage than I expected.	This USB stick works fine for both large and small files. I was disappointed that the size on my machine is 28.8 GB. That is smaller than the 30 GB that I expected. It was less cost, so I guess that evens things out.	0
337	Best burner I've ever had!	I've owned 5 CD burners, three of which lasted less than two weeks. Those three were 'bargain' brands, which led me to finally invest in this one, which I had heard was one of the two best ones available (the other one being the Plextor Plexwriter). Well let me just say I'm not sorry I went with the TDK. For reference, my system is a self-built AMD Athlon 1.2 ghz. with 256 megs of ram and Windows 98. I am using it in conjunction with a Creative 52X CD drive. I installed each on a separate IDE channel and the first thing I did after installation was do a 12X Music CD copy directly from the Creative to the TDK using a Maxell 80 minute CD-R Music CD. This burner flies! I didn't time it, but I left the room for a couple minutes and when I returned, it had already finished! I was skeptical, so I took my newly burned CD out to my stereo and it played absolutely perfectly from beginning to end. It was indistinguishable from the original. Installation was easy and I never once looked at the manual, although if you've never installed one before, the manual appears to be complete and should get you through okay.The burner's blue tray adds a subtle beauty to my system and really makes it look pro-built. It comes with great software too, including Ahead Nero 5.5, TDK Digital MixMaster, InCD CD-RW Packet Writing Software, and Adobe ActiveShare. Nero, while not quite as user-friendly as some others, is the most complete set of tools I've seen come with a burner, and is fairly self-explanatory once you've fooled with it for a bit. And of course the TDK also comes with Buffer Underrun Protection. I can't think of a thing that would cause me not to recommend this fine product. It's super-fast, well-built, reliable, easy to install, and easy to look at. If you want professional results, this is the one to get.	0
338	no protection.	Although the case is nice to look at, it offers no protection if your ipad is dropped. Does not protect corners or critical edges.	1
339	Slim and very quiet keyboard	I spend my days on conference calls taking notes while I talk.  My keyboard must be both quiet, fast and have a small footprint in tight spaces.  This is it.  I've replaced all my old, clunky keyboards (5) with this model.	0
340	Expensive, but it's nice.	I've had it for a week and been shooting on my D700.  It is awesome at 2.8 and very sharp.  I have a lot of lenses at 2.8 and nothing nearly as sharp as this lens.  Saturation is great and focus is super quiet.  Used it on my D7000 for a bit and didn't feel any more off balance than with my d700.Pros- very sharp- solid build- fast, quiet autofocus- bokeh looks awesome- saturation is greatCons- expensive- solid build = heavy	0
341	I'm impressed, but...	This looks cool.  I'll admit, that's the only reason I bought it.  It's the size of a house key, and goes unnoticed on my keychain.  The build quality is not quite what I was expecting.  What you have here is a very thin stamped metal sheeting covering the internals--in other words, not very durable, but looks the part.  There is also a very flimsy cover that goes over the tip of the key.  I'm not sure if it will hold up over time, but it has stayed in place the two days I have owned it.	1
342	It's neat!	Setup took me ~5 minutes, it was incredibly easy and quick.There are complaints that the Chromecast doesn't work on certain routers and such, I suppose that it is a hit or miss. However, if it does end up working for you (which it most likely will) then you're golden.Let me say that my most used apps are Netflix and YouTube, which makes the Chromecast ideal for my set up.People will complain that the Chromecast doesn't do everything; obviously it doesn't. But for $35, it does A LOT.Devices such as the Apple TV and the Roku will in fact do more with much more developed app support.But let's just remember how long those devices have been out in comparison to the Chromecast.Give it time, the Chromecast will catch up.Suffice to say, the Chromecast is in its infancy. It has been out for roughly 6 months now, and not much has changed.Yes, a recent update brought a bevy of new apps, but in many ways, the Chromecast has not changed much.But that doesn't mean that the Chromecast is bad--if you take away anything from my review it's this: The Chromecast WORKS.As far as actual performance, your mileage may vary. For me, I have a pretty good internet connection so streaming is pretty good. Buffer times are good and the displayed content will switch from 360p to 1080p fairly quickly.Quite honestly, this was one of my favorite purchases of the year. It's something that I can see myself using for a long long time.	0
343	Bought it because it's a Pelican	I originally bought this to keep small electronics in when I travel.It's purpose evolved to now it's THE case for my Bosch laser measuring device.Bosch GLR225 RT 230 ft Distance MeasurerIt fits perfectly!	0
344	Very good camera for the price	I purchased this camera to take with me to Iraq while deployed.  I wanted something that would fit in my pocket, have good zoom capability but was fairly inexpensive.  This has been a terrific little camera.  I let my 11-year old son use it before I left and he took some terrific photos with it.  I'm really surprised at the One- and  Two- star reviews stating they had fuzzy pictures, etc.  He and I have had no problems.  It does have a slight lag in the auto-focus, which is pretty much an issue with all point and shoot digital cameras, that's why I rated it as a 4-star.  But what do you expect for a little over $100.  If you are shooting scenes with lots of motion, sports or kids moving, etc., a point and shoot is the wrong camera anyway, you'll need to move up to DSLR to be happy.  When I return, I'll pass this camera on to my son and I'll be confident knowing that he has a good, relatively inexpensive camera to help capture his memories.	0
345	Good balance of features	I just picked up my first really long lens - 70-200 2.8 nikkor and have woken up in a new world as far as storage goes.  Between air travel and enjoying outdoor photography I want a backpack - no reason to have a tack sharp lens to walk around town - you want to take little photo-safari's.So I'm reading about a lot of packs - some from naneau pro look nice but they're not in stock and not carried at local dealers.  Lowe pro has some good ones too but the ones they have big enough for a longer lens are either too big or don't have a laptop sleeve.The Tenba bag is a big bag - you watch the video and it looks pretty small.  The thing that hits me is that the insert is equally tall all the way around - obvious if you want to carry two bodies, but I only have one body and would like to carry something besides camera stuff in my bag for travel - I like to go light and carry everything on.  This thing won't go under the seat and I'm concerned about being tagged with two carry on items as large as this thing is.It's going to be a challenge to fit this in a turbo-prop overhead but you can use the compression straps to slim down the top of the bag if you remove one of the vertical ribs and turn that horizontal.  The point is that this bag is so wide that I can turn my camera with 20-700 mounted horizontally and make the top of the bag mine for stuff.  Hopefully that will help me fit it in the overhead.  Fingers crossed, cause I'm not about to check $$$$$ worth of camera and computer equipment.You know, there is no perfect backpack that I've seen.  It seems like at this size, everyone assumes you are going to have so much crap that you're going to dedicate your bag to photography alone.  For those of you like me that want something non-descript to avoid the watchful eye of thieves, have enough space for gear and more, have some weather proofing options and some really nice waist belt padding (which as a long-time hiker is really appreciated) - you're going to have a hard time finding a better option.Four stars for matching my needs, but five stars when compared with what else is out there.Good luck!	0
346	Cute, works well, but TINY!	First of all, this flash drive is adorable! It's so tiny and comes in bright colors!It was so cute, I wondered if it would really work? To my surprise, it worked beautifully! No troubles at all.My worry is twofold: One, the contacts are constantly exposed. There is no cover to protect them so I question how long it will last. Two, it is so SMALL! I've been putting right here on my desk and I've already lost it twice among the normal desk clutter!	1
347	Works great for a backup	These batteries work well for a backup to the stock Powershot SX50 battery that comes in the camera as the charge does not last nearly as long. Charging from empty to full takes about 4 hours, which is normal but still inconvenient. We will see how long they last.	0
348	screen protector	Great anti glare screen cover. Goes on super easy and there is no glare. I recommend it highly even though I have a protective case.	0
349	Works Fine	I had a problem getting the proper software and drivers to install the unit.It would have been easier if the software was included.	1
350	Must have for gopro hero3	always had spares for my other gopro (wasabi brand also) so went with these when i got the hero3. Definitely great quality again, and you really need these more as hero3 doesn't have as good battery life as the previous.external charger is a must have to easily cycle batteries, and be able to charge without having to keep gopro out of the case. great price as well.	0
351	Good quality	I'm very happy with this cable. I wanted one of this since I have my MP3 player and a car radio with AUX IN. It's made of good materials and it has awesome quality audio output.	0
352	Cannon Powershot ElPh 115 16MP Digital Camera	My daughter really like her cameral, she's been asking for one for sometime, her favorite color is blue and the handling of the camera is easy for her.	0
353	It makes me feel like I am a real Photogrpher, get it and you will love it.	I can't get over the fantastic sharpness, near perfect exposure, this Camera provides in AUTO setting.  A true &#34;Point and Shoot&#34; and I am just beginning to understand all, well most, of the Functions.  Don't let all the Whistles and Bells Scare you, if you are just wanting to take pictures of friends and family, you will look like an expert.  You may become addicted and really get into what all this Camera can do, even at long distances it is incredible.  I have shots of a nesting Bald Eagle from 200+ feet where you can count feather and pick out the smallest detail.  The Camera will take a huge 32 Gb card but an 8 Gb is plenty,  just be sure it is a fast one like a SanDick Extreme HD Video.  I also purchased the Two Pack Battery and Charger Kit which was an excellent choice as it is small and works well.  The Case (none comes with the Camera, Booo) which is listed in the &#34;Buy Together&#34; really doesn't fit the Camera well.  While it is well made, It is a tight and awkward  fit and made worse by the Neck strap, you may look at my review, I'm looking for a replacement.	0
354	Picked this up as an extra power supply and it has been working like a charm	Reliable and has been in pretty much constant use since I got it and it works.  What else needs to be said?	0
355	Quiet as a mouse	This is thin and mouse quiet and keeps my notebook cool.  I like how thin it is as it fits into my notebook case as well.  Using it I could not hear any noise from the fan and I like the USB plug since it allows me to keep the USB port available for other devices.  I highly recommend this product especially if you have a notebook or laptop that gets very warm.  The size is perfect for a 15 inch notebook.	0
356	Works Perfect for me.	Not sure why everyone says it doesn't work.I mainly used this on my iPhone 4s for mirroring the screen and also for watching movies in hotel rooms on trips.I have also used this on verison 1 iPad.  It won't mirror the screen until you jailbreak it, which I did.  It does play movies though without jailbreaking.Great way to watch movies on the TV and charge your phone.Only complaint is that the connection is larger then a normal power cable.  See picture I posted.  So you might have to take your case off to use.	1
357	Just what I was looking for!	I ordered this sleeve - because I was looking for something that I could put my iPad into when I carry it around with me in my purse / bag. And this sleeve is perfect. I like the way it looks and feels, and the iPad fits snugly in it.If you are looking for something that will hold your iPad and just that (nothing else is gonna fit in there!), then this is just the perfect thing for you!And yes, there is a little cardboard (?) thingy that comes in with this sleeve that makes a stand .. I wasn't expecting it (I guess I didn't read the details much) but its ok.. nothing great...	0
358	Great value	"This is my 1st experience owning a LCD screen other then a cell phone. I prefer Plasma however plasma screens aren't made smaller then 42"". The contrast and color isn't as washed out as I had thought it would be. Gaming looks good play ""WoW"" often, its light and easy to move and set up. For it's size and quality I couldn't find any better in this price range (B Buy had a sale for $250 in Sept 08). The black finish makes the room appear more sophisticated and clean. I'm also a big fan of the blue power light vs the traditional green."	0
359	Always a Logitech Mouse	I like the way a Logitech mouse feels in my hand. The fit, the weight, the way it slides on the mouse pad. This is the forth Logitech mouse I own and all of them just felt right. The reason for 4 stars is the Setpoint Software. You will get an error message after a few minutes and then the Setpoint Software shuts-down. I uninstalled the software and just use the Windows XP drivers. The only thing the Setpoint Software shows you that the Windows Control Panel can't is the battery level of the mouse. All the other mouse options can be set in the Control Panel / Mouse settings. When they update the software I might try it again but for now it works great and have no issues with the mouse.	1
360	Garmin Zumo 350LM bad software some quality issues and crappy screen	I have had my unit for 6 months.The second time I used it in the car cradle the socket broke. I have owned numerous Garmin and this has never happened before. The cradle piece was replaced by the store but they made me pay for shipping(which was almost as much as the cradle). When I got the new cradle it doesn't fix properly and will fall out if you move it down.A couple of weeks ago I was using the 350LM in my car on my way to Indianapolis from northern Michigan. It directed me via Detroit even though I-69 was 10 miles longer but more direct. No options for alternate routing. On the way back the unit froze at 80% at least 6 times when calculating the route home. Frustrated I finally just used my smartphone and Google maps. When I got back I contacted the store and he suggested it had to do with avoidances. I removed all and it still froze up at 80% when calculating. At this time the only way to use my unit is to put it in car mode. Motorcycle mode will freeze at 80% every time. This is bad software and obviously others are having same issue since at least last year. Why doesn't Garmin fix this software problem?Issues summary:- poor plastic molding breaks easily- poor plastic tolerances creating bad cradle fit- GUI screens you can't fully customize- software freezes when calculating routes- screen is not visible in bright sunlight.- no screen contrast adjustment- you have to go from map to main menu to adjust volume	1
361	Clip broke	Great little player if you want something small for the gym or whatever, but the clip broke and I just threw in a drawer somewhere.	0
362	Cannot tell the difference	I bought this for my new HDTV  and let me tell yah it's no different than the expensive Monster cables you see at BestBuy.	0
363	NIKON WIRELESS SHUTTER RELEASE REMOTE	No instructions for specific camera, however, was able to find on internet what to try and eventually found item on camera menu to make it work.  Works great!	1
364	garbage	This doesn't even rate a star but this forum forced me to choose at least one!  It is pure trash with the worst headset ever.  Literal translation from another language doesn't translate into understandable English.  It doesn't work on any level and is a total waste of money.  Didn't find out these reviews when I ordered it otherwise I'd still have my money!!!!!!!!	1
365	Fur lined and too tight.	This cover is far too tight for the Macbook Air. The zipper is eventually going to damage the finish on the Macbook Air. The interior is also made out of a (hopefully) fake fur. The iPhone pocket is also lined with the same fur. Fur = Not good for electronics.	1
366	Marumi Circular Polarizer	So far, it meets the expectation. No sticks to the lens and hard to unscrew it as some reviewers wrote.	1
367	As advertised	I usually don't have a need for a cable this long but wanted to be able to plug it in while on the bed, the outlets are quite a bit away.  Worked good.  Quality looks good.  Price was great.	0
368	First Rate	Its getting real boring say the same thing over and over. First rate on service and first rate on quality.	0
369	Works great	Works great and feels solid.  I'd buy again if I needed another.  The only gripe is that the plastic on the small end is chunky but chunky = quality and it's just small enough for my use so no problems.	0
370	Reverse ring	OMG, I took a penny, put it on my kitchen table, took a picture it's so close you can see Lincoln inprint on the penny, you can see all the details, freakin insane. I like this one a lot, if you want to get up close get one of these for your camera.	0
371	Surprisingly Easy!	Easy to use, yet packs in a complex set of tools that will keep a master busy for years to come. Keep in mind, this is the complete version and comes with numerous extras that you do not get with the download only version. Corel has once again changed the paradigm in a real graphics interface. There is simply nothing else like it on the market.	0
372	Too Slow and Noisy for the Price	Comparing this camera to its smaller sibling the HX20V which has the same sensor but lacks a viewfinder, this big brother is supposed to be better right? This is why it is much more expensive. The fact is that it is only mildly better. I was very disappointed to discover they did not included a faster processor to reduce the annoying lag between each picture taken. We are talking about waiting anywhere between two to three seconds before you can take another photo. That is an eternity for any camera let alone a camera in this price range.The quality of the viewfinder is just mediocre, when the camera detects your eye it take a whooping two seconds to switch from LCD to viewfinder mode, that is an eternity when you are shooting fast action.On one hand this camera offers an easy way to shoot with a 30x zoom but if you are a pro I doubt you will be happy with the resulting noisy images. I tested the camera at noon in a snowy landscape and the noise was unacceptable compared to any other camera.There is one major design flaw. the power button is not recessed enough so the camera keeps turning itself on inside the bag hence extending the telephoto lens and getting jammed, this will most certainly damage the camera after a short while.	1
373	Very dark and not a smooth mount.	I understand how ND filters are supposed to work and have them in other sizes by other manufacturers. This one is just way too dark and not threaded properly. Waste of money!	1
374	Good router, good price, no problems	After using Linksys routers for a while now, I bought this for use in my dorm room. I had two computers and about 5 or 6 mobile devices connected to it with no problems at all, although that might be due to the extremely fast internet at my school. Still, I didn't encounter any problems with linking my devices or setting up the software, and even the guest network worked pretty well-something that tends to be a problem with a lot of routers. If you're looking for a medium level router, then this one won't do you wrong.	0
375	Fantastic Quality for the Money!  Easily Worth 3 X This Price!	"When I first ordered this imager, I wasn't holding out too much hope of being blown away with the image quality. After all, a high end version of a device like this can sell for a heck of a lot more than $50.00!  I mean seriously...  What kind of quality could I expect out of a version that sells for under fifty?  How about nearly as good?  I'm totally serious!  This thing is GREAT!  I recently purchased and returned several USB equipped digital microscopes looking for one that could not only give me impressive results through the eye piece, but also high quality SHARP images on my computer that I could then save, archive and share.  Unfortunately, all of the models I purchased prior to my last had at least one fundamental FLAW in the design that made it a poor choice for what I was looking for.As I was boxing up the 5th digital microscope product for return and refund to Amazon.com, I decided that I would just focus on a quality microscope first and worry about the computer side of things later. After spending a few hour reading up on the latest brands and models of quality scopes, I purchased theCelestron 44104 500x Power Advanced Biological Microscopefrom Amazon.  Folks, this is a GREAT scope for the money and I highly recommend it if you are looking for something solid with excellent optics without spending a fortune!  You can read my review of this great product in my reviews section. After using the scope for a few sessions and being thoroughly satisfied, I found myself still longing for that computer interface option.  I then searched the web for a stand alone USB microscope camera and was pleased to see that there were such things on the market!  My first search brought up a link to this product here on Amazon.com.  The fact that it was made by Celestron was a good omen and I figured that it should mate to my scope without too much trouble.  (Turned out to be totally true!)As I said earlier in my review, I was a bit skeptical on the quality based on the price and some of the low review scores this thing had received.  But, since low reviews on a product often say more about the reviewer's skills to read and follow instructions than they do about the product's quality, I went ahead and ordered myself one. After waiting for what seemed like an eternity *, the device arrived today and within 5 minutes I had the imager installed in the adapter ring and sitting on top of my 44104 in place of the eyepiece.I am using a Macintosh computer and as usual the Mac support from Celestron was practically nonexistent. This didn't bother me though because I already owned a copy of what many consider to be the best webcam software available on ANY computer platform.  I am of course referring to the award winning ""EVOcam"" webcam application from EVOlogical.  I plugged in the USB cable from the imager, fired up EVOcam and held my breath! My heart was racing as I pulled into focus my first slide.In a word... WOW!!  Not only did the image look EXACTLY like it did to my eye with the conventional optics, the imager was reproducing every byte of sharpness and brilliant color contained in the specimen under the objective lens!  I really don't think you could ask for any more from an imager than this!  With my 44104 now paired up with a great piece of webcam software like EVOcam, the sky's the limit in what I can do with this rig!  How about time-lapse movies of a bacterial culture growing?  The feeding habits of an Ameba of Hydra as it goes about its day?  I kind of feel sorry for the PC folks out there that don't have a program like EVOcam to use with their scope and this imager!So there ya go... Buy yourself a quality microscope first and then pick up this imager second for the ultimate digital microscope setup!  As for the 1-Star reviewer's opinions here on this product page?  I'll go with ""UTTERLY CLUELESS"" on a good day and down right idiotic on a bad one.  I don't know if the scope they were trying to use this thing with was total garbage, or they simply don't know how to read an owners manual!  Either way, their low review scores say more about their own reading and comprehension skills than anything related to this product.* My only gripe is with the retailer who sold me the product. (Adorama Camera) It took WAY TOO LONG to get here!  Come on people!  10 days?  That is ridiculous!  If you have a choice in which retailer to purchase this from on Amazon, CHOOSE SOMEONE BESIDES THEM!  Unless you don't mind waiting 10 days for your imager to arrive in your mailbox.  ;o)"	0
376	Fits just right.	"I was looking for a 32"" LED TV for the bedroom but had very limited height space. I looked for a long time and came up with only a few choices. I picked this unit because of the sound leveling feature (was tired of loud commercials at night). Also wanted a TV with a narrow bezel. The TV arrived in less than 24 hrs. .... GREAT. It installed perfectlly using the mounting stand. Its been only 3 or 4 weeks now but everything works great. The picture while not as good as my 26"" Sony LCD Bravia or 58"" Panasonic plasma is very good. Also, the sound leveling feature really does work."	0
377	It didn't perform as well as it should  have for the price.	Didn't hold it's settings.  I was constantly having to adjust the picture so that my friend that I talk to on Skype, could see me with any type of clarity.	1
378	Good.....but	These headphones were for my 15yr old son - he loves them, I don't.  They sound really good for the kinds of things 15yr olds listen to, but for me, they only sound good on guitar rock.  Subtler music and they are not as good.  Still if they were more comfortable, they would certainly be usable - problem is they feel like I'm wearing a couple of softballs around my head.  Cannot get used to them.  That being said, my son is not parting with them anytime soon, so that is probably a good thing for me.	1
379	Good price and size,  Nice colors.	These work just fine and are a good price.  Multiple colors were a nice bonus as well.  Good construction no-snag connectors,	0
380	Excellent Hard Driver Perform Well	Plug and Play, easy install.  Fast wake up from energy saving mode.  Fast transfer and write-&-read rate.  Reliable and never gets too hot.  Slim and sturdy, easy fit into tiny space on desk.  Quite and the status light indicated drivers being access in different speed.  Provide on-off switch at the back.	0
381	Great Charger!	I love this charger! I mostly use it when im on the go or travelling and it manages to fill up my battery 1.5x before i have to recharge it! Lately (a couple months after purchase) It seems like it only barely charges my battery up once before dying but i havent used it enough to be 100% sure! Regardless for the price this has some good value behind it and can really help you get out of a jam if you need to charge your phone with no outlet nearby!	0
382	Great iPad case!	For the IMP37B (iPad 2/3 case), This case provides more stabilization than any other case I have ever used. I really liked the feel of the hard plastic on the back and on the front. The fact that new trent provides a front protector is great and very smart. It is something that I was exactly looking for. The hole in the back is centered just perfect to see the apple. These little things add a lot to this case. As far as protection goes, I would trust this case against most falls but you should not be worried about that because when holding this case, it should never fall because of the letter strap you hold. The quality of the strap impressed me because it was firm at first but broke in really quick and was nice and soft before I knew it. All of the ports work flawlessly with the case on with no problems at all. Because the case only holds onto the four corners, I wanted to see exactly how well it hold on to the iPad, so I slid my hand in the strap and acted like I was throwing my iPad on my bad. I could not believe how much this thing took. I was trying my hardest to get my iPad to fly out on my bed and this case simply would not let go. This is something that I should go into consideration when purchasing this case because it really is designed very well. One thing that I struggled with was putting the leather strap on. While the directions are quite easy to follow, it took me a little while to get the holes on the leather in the allotted area. With this being said, I still would give this case 5 stars because there is seriously nothing wrong with it. It is perfect for what is it supposed to do. I would recommend this case to any iPad user who needs a free hand sometimes (especially teachers and people who make presentations.)	1
383	Works fine except in hot weather	This neck strap works just fine and is inexpensive.  The only problem is that neoprene is not very comfortable on your skin in the hot weather.	1
384	Lexerd Anti-Glare Laptop Screen protector	I bought this product a while ago for a HP PC that I owned.  Frankly, I think that it was overpriced.  The quality was not that good and it was tricky to put on.  Would not have recommended it to others.	1
385	Worked well in multiple devices	No problems after a summer of solid use in many different kinds of cameras. Data flow is quick, and nowadays you need high class SD's for the latest devices.	0
386	Awesome!	This product is awesome. I have had these speakers for a little over a year now and they still function as promised.	0
387	Rugged, Waterproof, and perfect for Dell XPS 13	If you have an XPS 13 Ultrabook and don't want the dell Leather offerings, this is a great alternative.  The exterior looks and feels rugged.  I believe it is waterproof though haven't tested.  You cannot tell from the picture but the way the flap folds over it does cover the opening by folding both sides of the case over it. Water is not going to get in. Especially just raindrops, but may even withstand a coffee spill.If you are looking for padding, it is minimal.  It is not as padded as the neoprene case I was using. Still I feel pretty safe with this in my Swiss Gear back pack. It's perfect if you already sticking it in an already padded backpack, but I am also fairly comfortable in a non-padded messenger bag. The raised rubber you see on front does feel like it provides some protection. Certain keeps the scratches and basic dings off, just might not take as much of a bang as the neoprene would absorb.The other reason I like this bag is because the XPS 13 doesn't feel too small for it or slide around in it.  Usually their is too much room in anything made for the slightly larger macbook air. Not so with this one. Feels like it is made for it.Last note, the felt on the inside is very nice.  Important for a metal finish like the Air or the XPS 13.	0
388	Good little box	Works and sounds good. All the instructions were in Spanish though - good thing everything is pretty self explanitory. Very good sound for small speakers.	0
389	It is already 80% used	While buying laptop battery dont look at the price only. Normally lower price means it is already used heavily. It happened to the battery I have bought.	1
390	GREAT DVD BURNER	great dvd, program took a little time to load. works greatalways like samsung products. nice and slim the 2 usb hook-up works great in front of my desktop. when i'm done i can switch it to my other desktop.	0
391	Works perfectly. Relatively small, does everything advertised.	Works perfectly.  Relatively small, does everything advertised.	0
392	This works perfect!	I was having problems at first, I couldn't get it to work.  I changed the settings and that was the problem.  Now, I use all the time.  Shooting a lot of star trails and other things and the RFN-4 hasn't let me down.  I'm not sure of the range yet, but I've set my camera up in the back yard and remotely opened the shutter from inside the house.Perfect!	0
393	Seems to work well	No issues using this with a D80.  Thus far it seems to be exceeding the battery life of the OEM battery when it was new.	0
394	Good Speaker Package	I bought these from a Gold Box promo. Could not have made a better decision. They perform well and are compact(with exception of sub woofer.	0
395	nice	small and portable. Easy to use and helps spread the light without bulky items to carry around.  Doesn't spread the light as much as a diffusers though.	0
396	Good reader	I think its very fast in both reading and writing to my 64GB SDXC card. If it doesn't work on XP OS, Microsoft web site has an updated driver to make this work.	0
397	Enjoying it.	I love the portability of this as a notebook and tablet while having the functions of a Windows OS. Windows 8 just takes some time to get used to but isn't as bad as the negative complaints I've seen.	0
398	Easy to Set-up and Use	I have connected 3 of these devices to various hardware throughout our loft (2 Linux Mint boxes and one Squeezebox) to improve wireless reception, stability, and speed.  The set-up was easy and the performance has been fantastic!  These adapters are paired with an Asus RR-N66U router with a 2 fold improvement in speed and 10 times the stability of the signal from the old router/ WiFi g set-up.	0
399	Must have accessory	The ones I bought fit perfectly and do protect the Clip Zip.  The cover does not interfere with the controls at all.	0
400	Transcrend Must Have Listened to Feedback	I bought this package for the Panasonic DMC-FZ100. So far, after about 1000 photos and many videos, it has worked flawlessly...but then it has been in use for only two weeks. As for its longevity, we shall see. Photo writing at full resolution is instantaneous - amazing. High definition video writing takes about 1 to 2 seconds - excellent for video.Also, the USB connector on the card reader is metal and the plastic holder is encased in clear tape, thus preventing any injury to the case in case it is dropped. Transcend must have listened to the complaints.Five Stars without reservations.	0
401	Good build quality	Served its purpose well. I used it for a stereo install on my truck and it worked just as advertised.	0
402	So comfortable	One for me and one for my wife, the glory of the 2 pac :)  These fit well and are super comfortable.  My wife uses with her iPhone 4 and I use with my iPhone 5.  Fits both great.	0
403	Good Product	Good deck, works as advertised. Is SATA interface not IDE.	0
404	Great keyboard case!	"This is a fantastic keyboard case. It stands out from the rest with its ability to hold the iPad either horizontal or vertical. Bluetooth works seamlessly. Lots of great ""quick"" buttons that make it very user friendly. Very durable case that will protect your investment. I am very happy with my purchase!"	0
405	Bit overpriced for a very short cable	With most of our electronics usually requiring a hook up to a computer, a desk full of cable attachments has become a necessary evil. Luckily, cable replacements have become very inexpensive and plentiful; however, RCA has made a replacement cable that does not follow the norm and is extremely short and not that good of a value for the money. This cable definitely has durability, but so do others, that have a longer reach and a cheaper price tag.	1
406	Works with MacBook perfectly	Works with MacBooks perfectly.  It is nice to always have one with me when traveling so I can download my camera immediately.	0
407	Sweet, Sweet Sound	This is the best-sounding MP3 player I own (out of five players including a second generation 16Gb iPod).It is small, has good to great battery life, excellent earbuds and is expandable via the SD slot. Very few products in this price range are in the same class.Very easy to add and delete anything since it looks like a standard USB mass-storage device to the operating system. Thus additional software is not required. Perfect for a multiple OS household or office. When I got my ZEN, I just used a file manager to transfer about 14Gb of wrapped albums to the player. After removal from the USB port and turning on the ZEN there was a brief pause while the new files were cataloged. At that point everything was ready for play.CONS: 1) Cannot use generic AC adapters to charge. Must use true USB port or expensive AC adapter from Creative. 2) Would have preferred hold switch on case rather than software hold that requires three button pushes each time.4.5 out of 5.0 star rating. Very pleased with purchase.	1
408	Great Product	I bought this TV because the price is lower than other LED TV's and this product have a good rate, i don't know nothing about Sceptre but after a research I realized that this is a good brand.About the TV, it is a great product has a clear image, a very good definition and a good brightness all of these features can be modified by the user so is possible configure it just like you want.The sound, it is good but not great, I mean you can play a game or see a movie with a pretty good sound but is not a good idea listen loud music on it.Slim, lightweight, easy to install a really good product.	1
409	Awesome surround sound headset.	The sound delivered by these headphones are spectacular and the feel is very comfortable. It is really cool watching HBO's Game of Thrones and hearing things behind you. The surround sound on these are amazing. Not as good as my incredible sound system but wonderful for a headset. I never knew that this sort of thing was possible for headphones. I ordered these several months to half a year ago and they still work as perfectly as the day I got them.	0
410	Nice Little Camera	Update: April 11, 2013, thought I would check back in and let you know that the camera is still going strong and we are more pleased with the camera than ever, great shots, we use it for sporting events all the time.This is a great point and shoot with some really robust features. You can tell that this one was thought through, and that the finished product (quality pictures) was always the goal in each of the features.The size of the sensor is huge. Not as big as the dslr's but a leap forward for point and shoots and will produce some surprising images. Also you know that the megapixels on this is monstrous, for big big photos. That is not to say they everyone is looking to make 16 x 20 or bigger enlargements of their pics, but you can if needed which is awesome. the best thing about the huge pictures is that you can crop them and find a picture within a picture if your hand is steady.And that brings us to the image stabilization. Works as intended and thats not something you will find on many point and shoots.Panorama feature is a little difficult and wonky / hit and miss, but its there if thats what you are into.All in all great and doesnt weigh a ton for what it does. As always if you have any questions just ask me.	0
411	ASUS T101MT convertible netbook is awesome	"Prior to purchasing the T101MT, I'd owned the Entourage eDGe dual-book - both virtually at the same price point. There is no comparison. The ASUS is hands down the clear winner! I was immensely dissatisfied with the eDGe and AMAZON was kind enough to allow me to return it for an 80% refund 3 months after AMAZON's official return policy. ***** for AMAZON (that's 5 stars BTW!)!When reviewing the T101MT, one should be careful what is being considered when evaluating the ASUS. Prospective buyers should distinguish between the hardware and some proprietary software ASUS provides versus Microsoft's Windows 7 that comes with the product. This review is not so much about the Windows 7 operating system as it is about ASUS' product.Though ASUS is marketing the T101MT as a touch 'tablet', people's natural tendency is to compare it with the iPAD tablet of comparable screen size. The iPAD is a very slick true 'tablet' product - ASUS' T101MT is perhaps better considered as a general/dual purpose netbook. The T101MT does NOT have the same screen interface experience as iPAD users are accustomed to. It is important potential buyers are aware of that as they would be highly disappointed if they did. That is not ASUS' fault, rather the shortcomings of Microsoft's Windows 7. Nevertheless, the T101MT has plenty of other advantages over the iPAD.Like most other netbooks, there is no CD/DVD drive. If/when one is needed, you'll need to connect an external device to one of its 3 USB 2.0 ports. It is strongly recommended buyers to purchase the upgraded version of the product - with 2G RAM and Windows 7 Premium. Windows 7 starter or home edition does not provide the full touch screen capability the premium does.Having 3 USB ports is very useful. Having the ability to offload the 250GB internal HDD via USB is a huge plus. For power saving considerations, the keyboard is not lit. Therefore typing in the dark is a problem. Luckily, one of the USB ports is on the side where a USB powered LED light can be plugged in. They're available for ~$5.Both Windows 7 and ASUS provide pretty good power management software so the product can operate for up to 4~5 hours on a charge - this depending on a number of considerations (eg: wifi, bluetooth, screen intensity, audio, etc. usage). It comes with a very, very small AC adapter making it easy to carry around.The biggest plus I think the T101MT has over other netbooks is its ability to convert to a 'tablet' format. On buses, airplanes and other tight places having the 'tablet'-like capability is very handy. The screen is reasonably responsive to the touch though scrolling browser windows up/down via 'flick' feature is cumbersome. In 'tablet' position, the on-screen keyboard works very well and easily. Unlike many other on-screen keyboards I've tried, this one is QWERTY formatted and fully functional - complete with control and function keys.T101MT is very quiet. People not accustomed to 10"" products might find the keyboard a bit cramped - that's a personal matter. However, the keys have a good feel to them, they are quiet, solid and removable/replaceable. The HDD is very quiet. I can use the T101MT without disturbing others around me.Compared to other netbooks currently on the market, I believe the ASUS beats them all including DELL's convertible netbook model. The rotating/folding screen works flawlessly and smoothly.I strongly recommend the product even though the price is higher than non-convertible netbooks. It's dual functionality obviates the need [for some] to buy an additional tablet and/or e-book reader."	0
412	Excellent Buy	No lag, excellent communication and perfect docking with the ASUS VivoTab..............buy it, you won't be sorry. Turns your Tablet into a laptop :-)	0
413	Frustrating As H_L_	I do not know which is more frustrating - this or my MacBook Air.  They are each strong in areas where the other is weak - and certainly the MBA has more comfort features like a better feeling and backlit keyboard - that make using it more pleasurable.  Nevertheless, I enjoy this Samsung - and I got it for a great price.  I like the size and for movie viewing - the screen on this thing is just gorgeous - better than the MBA and the 14 inch Samsung I also own.  For months - it was THE laptop that I carried with me everywhere - until I started using the MBA.While I really like this - there are a few things that just are very frustrating.1.  The random spastic jumping around of the cursor that happens on both of the Samsungs is something unlike I have ever experienced on any Samsung.  It sounds like a small thing - but try typing an important document for hours - and having to constantly correct the mistakes caused by your cursor relocating to random sections of it while you are typing.  I have tried the setting fixes I have found on line - so far nothing has worked.2. The battery life is ABYSMAL -  1.5 -2 hours at MOST.3. And this is my fault - (but it has made me appreciate the magnetic charging part of the MBA so much now) DO NOT drop this - especially while charging.  My plug was caught around my chair at work, and I did not know it, and I wheeled my chair in one direction and the comp came crashing down, bending the charging pin inside.  I thought this would be easy to replace - NOPE - it requires soldering to get it fixed.  And of course - once it fell - the 500 GB HD got damaged.  Considering that it fell just about 2.5 feet unto a carpeted floor, I am a bit surprised at the extent of the damage - but it is what it is.4. But the thing that downright confuses me is the processor.  For whatever reason - when I plug it in while watching a movie - the CPU usage maxes out  - making the computer absolutely USELESS.  I mean CRASH!  This is frustrating because the video quality on this is superior to all of my other computers.  As someone suggested, I installed a solid state hard drive a couple of months ago, but that did nothing to improve it.  I have been asking for help with this and changing settings on it for a year, this has not helped.I have another 4 GB of memory to put into it - but between the new HD - additional memory - and whatever it will cost to repair the charge port  - I am putting more money  than I should have to into getting this thing to work the way it should.  Would appreciate help if you have it.	1
414	Takes 2 entire days to setup	If you have the patience it MAY work after 2 days. Mine did for a while before concking out!I dont want to spend another 2 days...	1
415	HD Radio is awesome	I chose this model specifically for the HD Radio built in.  It's great to be able to listen to AM news & sports stations on a digital FM broadcast.  Also digital FM stations sound much better.The difference between my stock radio and this unit is significant.  The sound is much richer and cleaner even using the same stock speakers.  I was amazed when I first powered it up by the quality of the sound.I also bought the hardware to use with my iPhone 5.  Here I was a bit disappointed.  Maybe I should have dug deeper into what the Radio Apps really are.  I kind of thought I would be able to control my iPhone apps through the head unit.  This is not the case.I setup the VGA & USB cables to the Apple VGA adapter for the iPhone 5 and tried it out.  Unfortunately there is not sufficient power from the head unit to even maintain a charge on the iPhone.  After reading the specs in more detail I found there is only 1 amp of power from the head unit to the iPhone so it won't charge it.  In fact my iPhone 5 discharged faster connected to this unit.With all other features of this unit I am very happy.	1

417	Great USB splitter for under $5	The 4 Port High Speed USB 1.1 2.0 Octopus Hub Adapter arrived on time and in good condition.  This little device makes a world of difference.  Just plug it in.  I bought it because I had to disconnect something because my laptop had all of its USB ports occupied.  I recommend this product.  I rate this a 5 star because it is under $5 and makes it a must have for me.	0
418	A winner	Solid construction and easy to use. Much more versatile and lightweight than a traditional c-stand. Shipped it very quickly too.	0
419	Cordless USB Receiver Wireless 2.4G Optical Mouse Vista - BLUE	I opened the box to find the mouse but no USB attachment. Without it, the mouse as useless so I sent it back for a full refund.	1
420	Kindle Cover	This really protects the Kindle keeps it safe strong easy to use with the kindle in it Great product very nice	0
421	A great tiny speaker	I didn't know what to expect as far as sound, given how small this is, but I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality coming out of this little ball.  The speaker is about the size of a handball, and that it can produce the sound it does is pretty amazing.  One should not expect it to sound like a big speaker, but it is a great portable way to share recordings that are on a portable mp3 device like an iPhone or iPod.  The sound is much better than the speakers on those little devices.  One should not expect the sound to be as good as earphones, however, but you can't share earphones.  It is also well designed for functionality.  The small connector cord is all you need to plug into an iPhone, but they supply a longer cord if needed.  It charges by plugging into a USB connection on a computer or a USB wall charger (USB connector cord supplied).  When closed up, it really is just a little ball, and fits easily into the supplied carry bag, along with the extra cords.	0
422	Turned itself off the first day of use.	It's cute, it has a nice color and attractive lights that kill the battery quickly.  I used it one day and it turned itself off and never came back no matter what.  I returned it.	1
423	IF YOU HAVE A SONY YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS	IF YOU PREFER A HAND GRIP INSTEAD OF A SHOULDER STRAP, YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK THIS UP.LOOKS GREAT ON A SONY ALPHA CAMERA, BUT WILL WORK ON ABOUT ANY DSLR.GOOD COMFORT AND STYLE.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS STRAP.I OWN IT.	0
424	Sound bar for TV.	This is just what I needed in order to hear the TV better. The speakers that come with the new TVs are terrible and this does the job for a reasonable price.	0
425	So crappy, but what can you expect for 1/5 the price of a mac battery	It says that I need to service the battery and I just started using it.  Hopefully it will give me 6 months, then I will feel like even buying another one is a good call.  I'm ahead of the game instead of buying the mac one for $120.	1
426	Is not worth the trouble	Turn out to be uncomfortable to wear for any length of time and broke down after a short period of time. I cannot recommend it.	1
427	Works great, video quality and wide angle view are amazing ...	Works great, video quality and wide angle view are amazing for something this size. I like the interface and software for the product. The only downside is that the WiFi connection to the device fails a lot, you have to keep trying or reset both the device and the iPhone / iPad to get a connection. Otherwise everything is very impressive.	0
428	Small, Light, Works	I like to keep this little power strip in my notebook bag and it definitely comes in handy. It's small, lightweight and compact and provides some protected outlets. The only thing i don't like is how short the cord is, but even then, it's not that big a deal.	1
429	get'em as they work'em	Great earphones!!  Fits well in the ear and has gotten knocked around with my cell phone when I got a little excited listening to the music and waving my arms around while working out on the treadmill.  They're still going good through all of the abuse and I will get another set when these cannot take no mas!	0
430	Cheap and functional.	This adapter works as it should for the price. However, the included software is rather misleading/outdated. In order to make it work the way I wanted it to, I had to use Windows XP's drivers, figuring out how to work them was not easy and took some massive internet research, but I managed. If you can handle that then go for it. It works just fine.	1
431	I REALLY LIKE THE CROWN CASE	"This case was more then I expected , the price was great as well as the case. A lot lighter then another one I own, which I am glad it is. Well made leather and my Kindle Fire HD 7"" fits in case lke it should sleep / ake works good too."	0
432	cards slide out in cold weather	I bought this to keep my SD card music collection in my car's glove box.  Most of the time, it works fine.  On cold mornings, the vinyl stiffens enough that the SD cards slip out if one left the case upside-down.  Has space for 18 SD cards.	1
433	Radeon hd6670 1	Great video card for the money. Power consumption may be low enough to use with the original stock power supply that probably came with your computer.	0
434	Awesome for Gaming!	Very fast. CPU load never hits 100%, even when playing Battlefield 3 and watching Netflix. Multitasks very well. I highly recommend this CPU to anyone, even if you aren't going to be using it for gaming.	0
435	A very good headphones	First of all, nobody wants to review a $6 headphones. But there are over 3000 reviews which itself suggests how good these headphones are. These are good in $1-$30 range. Please dont compare it with the best out there. There is also CNET review available for these.I have an Iphone5 with Speck candyshell grip case and these headphones are not enough to connect thru the opnening.So, i took a knife and cut some and they fit now. They appear cheap and build quality is not great either but they sound great.I dont think anybody has time to read a lengthy review, so, thats all got. These are good to use and throw headphones which happen to sound great. I wonder if panasonic could make such excellent headphones for $6, why on the earth apple couldnt do that?	0
436	Works great.	Works as advertised.  I can plug in a USB dongle for a wireless keyboard/mouse combo to use with a tablet.	0
437	It's a screen protector	I just wrote a review about the iPhone-sized screen protectors and I'm not sure how much else I can say about the product.  It's a screen protector.  Follow the instruction to put it on right and it'll help keep protect your screen.  I didn't have any problems putting this one on or getting the few small bubble outs, but I feel like I've put enough of these on that I'm getting pretty good at them.I should clarify that I've put a lot of them on not because I've had to replace a bunch of them, but because my household owns three iPads and we've had a number of iPhones throughout the years.  I've also applied these for friends of mine who are too afraif of messing them up to do it themselves.	0
438	Solid Drive	This a solid Samsung/Toshiba external drive.  Simple plug and play.  Beautifully finished case.  Flawless performance.I also purchased the Case Logic EVA molded case for this.  It is a hard case for great protection and everything fits perfectly inside.A perfect choice for this quality drive.	0
439	Pretty good!	Pretty good sound, I like more bass and these are balanced.  Ipod touch powers them just fine.	0
440	This one works!  There is another alternative that does not &#8211; read this review	Do not buy the 1 cent +3.98 shipping alternative by &#34;Crazy Cart&#34;.  This product has the proper machine thread, 1/4x20, that is necessary to interface with standard camera gear.  For instance, the threaded hole on the bottom of your camera is 1/4X 20.  This is an extremely common American thread.The other adapter has a bolt that is approximately the right diameter but the thread is wrong.  It will start but will go no further than about three quarters of a turn &#8211; the thread is incorrect.  Amazon gave me a credit for this improperly sized product but I would have rather got it right the first time.  Furthermore, repeated commentary to &#34;crazy cart&#34; went on answered.  Stay away &#8211; but do realize that I am giving the product that this review appears under my unequivocal recommendation.  The right adapter is sold by HDE.	1
441	Why spend big bucks on a Harmony remote ?	If you have an Apple product , ipad /iphone/ipod this is what you need! The only problem is the new Apple Lightning plugs. My iPad is 2nd generation and this thing works great ! My ipod touch is a 5th generation with the new plug of course. You can use this with a Lightning plug just be careful which adapter you buy. All lightning adapters are not created equal. I went through a couple of cheap ones I purchased off the net. The knock offs will charge your lightning plug device , but about everything else is useless. I am sure this company will eventually come out with newer version for the newer Apple plugs. If you decide to go the adapter route , be sure and get the Apple brand. The Apple brand is the only one I know of that works properly. Some claim to work but do not. Another good thing about this product , it is designed and made in the U.S.A. , not cheap stuff from another country!	0
442	Just not worth the time or money	Quality stinks.  You're really better off not using one of the FM transmitters at all.  If you absolutely must have your ipod in your car and don't want to spend the money on buying a real adapter - just buy a good pair of speakers for it and listen to it that way.	1
443	Nothing.  Nada.  Zip.	"Tried and tried.  Multiple orientations, simply NO repeaters hit past 5 miles.  I compared this to a simple 1/4 wave dipole (per ARRL handbook)I made a couple hours ago with 1/16"" brass rod, same 6' of RG58U jumper and with the same handheld I'm hitting repeaters out to 30 miles.  This is falcon broken.It's going back ASAP.  Waste of time AND money."	1
444	Great accessories.	This is a great bundle of accessories for one with a new iPad.  This was a gift for our niece. Great for mom and dad ,too.  This bundle is great in that it has everything you need, for spares and extras.  You can never have enough with children.	0
445	Small	Too small !! not even an inch left literally !! Spare battery, Lens cap etc have no space ! unbelievable ! A total waste, now I am searching for a slightly larger one to keep the charger etc etc.	1
446	Works Great!	Definitely a must if you have a life proof case. Its a great adapter that works for any charger or dock. Definitely a recommend!	0
447	Excellent	This does just as it says.  It went on easy and does a great job protecting my Kindle Fire HD!  Glad to have it!	0
448	Excellent product !	The product was delivered on time and well protected on a hard cartoon box . The quality build is perfect designed  and it works  in a perfect way as well . On my Canon cameras I have installed Magic Lantern which I use it for HDR exposures and for time lapse but when it comes for long exposures brackets using ND 3.0 filter on BULB mode, this product is very helpful and I am  very happy with the performance !	0
449	Helping us help others	We already know about the quality of Seagate products and the prices are more than reasonable. My husband and I were able to help upgrade a computer for a business that is strapped for cash and needed access to important information. The computer is running very well to this day without any complaints to its capabilities.	0
450	Extremely Flexible	"If you have a consumer-grade camcorder, such as theFlip MinoHD Camcorder  2nd Generation, 2 Hours (Brushed Metal), like I do, you probably should use a tripod of some sort to stabilize your shots. Obviously, if your camcorder is smaller than a deck of cards, you probably aren't going to lug around a full sized tripod. Luckily, mini-tripods exist, which are (almost) pocketable, and make steady shooting (even if you're holding up the camera) much easier.The GorillaPod is a mini-tripod for cameras and camcorders with an interesting feature: bendable legs that conform to almost any surface. As you might imagine, it is very effective when placing your camera on uneven surfaces, such as rocks, blankets, and nearly anything found in nature. The extreme flexibility of the legs also allows you to clamp it onto vertical, horizontal, and diagonal handrails, chair-rails, guide-wires, and what have you. Indoors, chair backs make a great, impromptu stand.Flat surfaces, however, are more challenging to deal with. Every ""node"" of these legs, including where the legs and mount attach, is posable, and there is no easy way to perfectly straighten them. This means that you have to manually adjust the mount to ensure the camera is level. That's a minor inconvenience for such a cool and flexible tripod. I've even found that I can use its legs to steady the camera even while I'm holding it."	1
451	Excellant Quality for the Price	"I Own a New 13"" Apple Laptop and this case Holds iT perfectly with just enough room for the accessories.  Made Well and has plenty of Pockets and zippered compartments for your ac cord and mouse. Not a large Notebook Case so I would not order this if You have a Larger Notebook than a 14""."	0
452	Compact and Handles Various Multimedia Cards Well	I only was able to test this 8-in-1 Card Reader with a Class 10 MicroSD card but was surprised to find that it actually hit 13MB/s which is 3MB/s over the capabilities of a Class 10 MicroSD card which is rated to 10MB/s.  It handles SDCard and MicroSD card perfectly, is easy to fit in a pouch or pocket and easier in many cases to just carry one of these and pop an SDCard out of a device instead of carrying many different USB cable types.  The only thing preventing 5 stars is that it is wide and will block any adjacent USB ports on your laptop or desktop when plugged in.	1
453	Long and easy to use	Bought this primarily to play my Roland keyboard over my A/V system which sounds much better and louder than any small portable DC powered speaker.  Also enables me to play my ipod and other 3.5 mm output mp3 players (including PC's) music over the A/V system.  Length is great - Receiver is in the den and 25' goes to either the kitchen table or to the living room near the piano.  Excellent price for such a versatile item.	0
454	Using on a Canon 5D Mk III	I use my camera for very little video, but every year I'm drafted to film the family Christmas Party skits. Sound quality is vastly improved over the built-in mic.	0
455	Did not work!	I installed it on my Intel Lga775, and it wound not even boot up, all came on was my Cooler Master Cooling fans!	1
456	Good Provider and Excellent Package for Camera I Purchased but Returned	Very nice package that I had to return as I did not like the camera (SX500IS) and returned it. All of the package items worked fine plus there were some extra items included. This was a quality package and provider.	0
457	we have two now	This is a great quick charger.  My Kindle Fire battery only lasts about three hours when I'm playing games or surfing so this is really necessary.	0
458	Great	These are blank DVD's, not much too them. They weren't cracked, they work and they achieve the goal I need them for.	0
459	A Real Plug and Play	As easy as it comes to set up, a real plug and play.  Had no issue adding USB devices, either 2.0 or 3.0.  A great way to expand your USB port count on your computer.	0
460	A Great Product!	The product is everything and more. It's a little bulky and in my environment there are no traces of interference. It merits a Four Stars Plus, considering its contained price.	0
461	Sennheiser PX100-ll	These are so light you don't know you have them on. Love the controls and just the one wire hanging down from the headset. Great, great sounds. My second set. I recommend for any age. Decent price considering the high quality.	0
462	Thought I give seagate another try big MISTAKE	I primarily by western digital black or green hard drives but this seagate hard drive was to hard to pass up on black friday because of the $90 price tag.  The package arrived quickly but as soon as i installed the hard drive it booted up the computer it was clicking and chirping very loudly and would not show under windows 7 64 bit or even under my bios which supports hard drive larger than 2 tb.  returned with the quickness and bought a 2.5 western digital green drive.  stay away from seagate.	1
463	Great!	I have the computer about 3 feet away from me, and I can't hear anything. This is whisper quiet ..only a little bit of noise when gaming.5/5Great for the priceI put it in a dell inspiron 530	0
464	Slow process	"I originally reviewed this negatively after experiencing severe speckling on my new iPad (3) but have discovered that, after about 18 hours, much of this has disappeared so I imagine a large amount of moisture was trapped on the surface - I had only expected to see the usual bubbles. I'm still disappointed that using the squeegy (or something else) has resulted in two straight-line ""scars"" on the material but these are not visible when the device is switched on. It was not nearly as smooth an installation process as for the Zagg (which I have used on two other devices)and the final result - with remaining speckling and bubbles - is still awaited..I increased this to four stars after a better experience with my second protector."	1
465	This is my second VE248H	I love this monitor. The menu is great once you get used to it, and It has the adapter in the monitor rather than the cable. Asus quality, great 1080p monitor.	0
466	case for Nikon S630 Coolpix	Perfect size case to protect the camera from scratches in a purse and has a magnetic closing flap, and belt loop too. Leather, solid case.	0
467	HIFI EXPERIENCE	I must admit, like most that have reviewed this, when I first listened to these I was very skeptical on the purchase I just made. I decided not to prejudge and just let this burn in for about 30 hours of continuous music from my Cowon D3. After that I put them in my ears to see if there was any improvement and still was not very pleased on what was coming out, so I then grabbed my C-Moy amp plugged that in, I must admit it did help greatly, but still was not what I was expecting. I'm used to my UE triple Fi 10s, which are amazing. I then started to play with the different tips provided, which can be a bit cumbersome to change. So after experimenting with the tips I decided on the large single flange black ones and since I like having them behind the ears, I put the left one in the right ear and right in the left, they fit very nicely and extremely comfortable, there is an included cable which will switch the right to left and vice-versa. So after all the experimenting these have ended being up my new favorite Dynamic IEM. By the way these do sound good unamped with good quality sound like 256 kbps or higher, but amped gives it that little extra push being that they are 150 ohm buds. So it has ended up being a great Hifi experience. These will not replace my UE 10s, but I like to try different IEMs for the different sound signatures they produce.-------1 thing to add, it you buy from Audio Advisor which you should they are an authorized Hifiman Retailer, so your warranty will be valid...	0
468	A useful case for thumb drives	I will probably buy more of these cases, but I hope the price comes down.Also I want more colors and bigger capacities.	1
469	Title For My Review	I bought this digital media player through Amazon and it took 17 days before it arrived safely at my house, but once I easily hooked it up, perfect. I went to my nephews house and swiped his external H/D and put some movies I had on DVD on it and I'm good to go. Thank you and good night.	0
470	Didn't meet Apple Standards	This product just doesn't compare to the headset I received with the IPhone from Apple.  I was sent a 2nd one because the first one could not be heard well.  The sound was a fraction of the volume of the IPhone one, it had very little base and was just unsatisfactory.  Eforce City sent me a replacement.  It was better, but in my estimation about 75% the quality of the IPhone's.  It just doesn't have the volume, base or overall quality of the IPhone's.  I won't use it and it's not worth the cost of sending it back.  I would not recommend it.	1
471	Complete kit!	I love these flash gels, they are nice and tough and come in a great case. I wouldn't mind having a 2nd set, someday I'll order more.	0
472	4 stars give or take 1	This is cheap and works.If you do not have a case for your kindle/reader this might get in your way. For me I had a cheap case that I bought with it that folds back and snaps to the other side. I clip this over the front and back cover, pinching them between it, and it works perfect. Those that say it is too heavy need to pick up a regular book, paperback even, then pick up their reader with this on it and change their review. It is 3 AA batteries and some plastic, it isnt too heavy.The negative for mine is that it started flickering after about a week. I put new batteries in and it still flickers sometimes. I just move the light part around and usually fixes it. Probably a cold solder join or something. No biggy if it breaks I'll buy a new one, it was $3. If it wasnt for the flicker this would be a 6 star purchase.Before buying a $40 book light give 1 or 2 of these a try =).	0
473	Works as advertised  - and as reviews have stated	I hesitated a long time in getting this, but am glad I did.It does mount very easily to the back of my Samsung TV with one of the types of hooks provided.It DOES hide the cables from view (nice) and purely subjectively it seems as though the Apple TV is more responsive to the Apple remote. I have not tried it with the Remote app on my phone, so I can't judge that.Overall, for the price, it was a good purchase that worked as intended.	0
474	Very good high-powered stereo receiver	Despite the current fad for multi-channel audio/video recivers, most people still listen to music with just two speakers and, therefor, only need a two-channel stereo receiver. The Onkyo TX-8511 is a very good stereo receiver with plenty of power -- 100 watts per channel -- good performance specs, and all the features you really need. It's also quite reasonably priced. No matter how much you may be impressed with the cool concept of a multi-channel  &quot;home theater&quot; system, if your budget or available space dictate just two speakers why not stick with a good stereo receiver? And this is a very good stereo receiver for the price.	0
475	Great for the price	Fits snugly onto the lens and locks into place. So far I have no complaints. I feels a little cheap, but then, it was cheap - perfect for the amount of use it will get in my photo bag. Turns around backward on the lens for easy storage in the camera bag. Doesn't get in the way of the lens cap or filters.	0
476	It Works	Inserting it in the faceplate can be kind finicky but once it is set it is good to go.  Also screwing on the back side is a tad tricky but nothing overwhelming. This is a great piece to use between larger keystones as it acts as more of a open space versus an ethernet port for example. I used this in a 6 keystone faceplate with 5 spots used.  The other 4 were ethernet ports so getting everything locked in was not easy but this did help since it has an easy footprint in the plate.	1
477	Navgear universal dash mount for GPS	Very similar to what Garmin offers, just a rename in my opinion. Works as expected for slightly less than what you would pay if ordering from Garmin.	0
478	Beginner photographers, do not hesitate	I know nothing about photography i bought a cannon t2i on an impulse one day, and i wanted to mimic great shots that i see in music videos and movies, which led me to learning about these filters. They immediately made any further pictures i took look very professional. These fit perfectly on the end of my lens for my t2i, and were shipped in a soft case, wrapped in plastic. The filters were  flawless, and you cant beat this price for 3 of them, highly recommended :)	0
479	Works just as described	Been using it for a month now. Its paired with a Canon EOS Lens 18-55m kit lens for a Canon T1i. Over 500 shots with it and it works flawlessly	0
480	Better than the original	This charger cable is better than the original cable for the kindle which started unraveling within a year of purchase.  Fits the kindle well and seems to be more solid than the original.	0
481	Its Whatever	Its good if you want some type of glue on your iPod, and a lot of pressure on the sides. A lot of my head phone jacks couldn't fit into the opening, so I had to take it off every time. Other than that, its a nice design and feel.	1
482	Poor Reception.	The seller replaced the first unit I purchased because it did not work at all.  The replacement worked great in my driveway when I tried it but on the road it kept loosing the signal.  I don't use it because of this.	1
483	Good quality.	I bought this item together with my GPS. The quality is good, easy to use. But it is a little bit too big for my TomTom XL 340.	0
484	I ONLY dislike the new UI...so I fixed that.	"I run a triple boot system...Linux, Windows 7 Ultimate, and now Windows 8 (for over 6 mos).  Windows 8 takes up less space than 7, is faster, at least as stable, and with the price increase is too expensive...however, Microsoft did field an upgrade with this one (but only because they had to or stagnate).  The truth?  I hate it!  But only until I  drop the Metro UI and now boot straight to Desktop.  Then it shines.  IObit, Stardock and others to come have programs that totally skip Metro on the boot for free.  I use IObit ""StartMenu8"", and it's flawless.  Your Start button is back, your old desktop is right there, you can turn off the sidebar/corner activities (or not), and voila, you're looking at the newer/better/faster Windows 7.  And if you haven't yet tried the Metro UI on a Surface Pro tablet, then don't dog Microsoft.  That's what Metro is for, just doesn't belong on MY DESKTOP.  I have an iPad and that will change soon.  I don't like what Windows 8 doesn't have that '95, '98, XP, Vista and 7 DID have, either.  But what it does have and how it does it is better than any Windows yet.  And I'll not get into thoughts on corporate greed. Leave the Mac/Win debates to those dedicated forums...but do think about this:  with Windows if you don't like it, you can mod it..try that on a Mac OS.  I've used both for decades.  I just bought Windows 7 here at Amazon for a new build customer because he hated the Windows 8 Metro UI...don't make that same mistake!  Just use one of the above mentioned programs (or another) and actually upgrade/update your system with Win 8.  Just keep in mind that this system builder software is for a FULL NEW install only, it won't just upgrade and keep files/settings."	1
485	Well Made	This TTL cord is well made and works as it should.  The unit locks onto the camera so it won't pull free accidentally.	0
486	Great	Great budget soundbar for my budget LED tv it sounds way better than the built in speakers on my tv.	0
487	Great for the price	For the price these headphones are sold at they are a very good deal. They come with many sizes so they are bound to fit unless you are a giant or a newborn. The case is simple and functional and holds them nicely. The sound on my iPhone, which is the only device I tested, sounded great. Full rich bass and clear treble. MP3s tend to not match one another but coupled with the iPhone these brought out great sound with noticeable detail. They are also sturdy as I flew with them and traveled in Disney World for a week and they took a lot of punishment, even getting wet, and they were fine.	0
488	The Keyboard For Me	I was unsure about the keyboard for an iPad idea.  Our IT person at work said it would make the iPad a substitute for a computer.  My son asked why I would want to add a keyboard that would defeat the purpose of having a small light weight tablet?  I tried it for myself and I am sold!  My wife has tried it and she likes it too.The iPad and keyboard fit comfortably in the stylish leather case.  When open for use the iPad is supported by a stand which, like the keyboard, is held in place by a magnet.  The keyboard is easy to use and gives more a typical typing experience than is found with the touch screen on the iPad.  It is easy to set up and the keys are a comfortable size.To answer the questions, yes, if your iPad is linked to a printer, this keyboard makes the iPad a near substitute for a laptop.  This product adds little to the weight and size so this is no reason not to use it.  The OXA Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard with Covering Case and Chocolate Keys is the keyboard for me.	0
489	Good Processor.	I ordered this processor for an HTPC Build. Works quite fine and runs with with many applications. It did all of the tasks I've assigned it to do. So far it's been good.	0
490	Texas Geek	Smooth scrolling, easy set-up, and a bluetooth receiver for your computer. What else could you ask for with this sleek design rechargable mouse.	0
491	Good for young people	Toooo many lights flashing ALL the time -- prevent me from focusing.  This is distracting when working -- as feels like one is in a disco	1
492	Good quality cables.	I bought this cable and two other colors of the same brand 8 months ago, and they've been working great. They come in different colors for color coding your connections, which is nice. I've been getting my cables from Cables To Go since the mid-90's and they've always been very high quality at a great price. Highly recommended!	0
493	The size is right!!!	Classy looking and feeling.  Great to put in pocket and forget about.  Video is superb and pictures surprisingly good.  5x zoom is enough.  24 at wide end is excellent.  Fast.  Battery better than expected.  Definitely recommended.	0
494	AWESOME LARGE HDD	Ok I got an ASUS netbook and the 250GB drive was to small so I upgraded it to this one.It is a ASUS Eee PC Seashell 1201N-PU17-SL with the Dual core Atom N330 and now 640GB HDD. I partioned the HDD to have a 100GB Windows partition to make use of the fact I use this little beast for work. I also have the rest of the drive partitioned for the Linux partition I use. I also bought a Samsung 640 GB USB ext HDD to give me a combined 1.2TB of storage! I do like the 5400 RPM drive speed because while 7200RPM is faster if you have a lower spindle speed for you drive quite often the drive will last longer, and that's cool!I have not noticed a single issue with the drive, but I have only had it working for about a week so were still to early to give the long hours of use workhorse review, but I am very happy with it so far.	0
495	Absolutely love them. Great for gamers of any kind.	I ordered a pair of Gunnar Shaedog's and I have to say, I'm digging em.I've always been really skeptical about them but a couple of friends who are heavy computer users such as myself have made a strong recommendation in the Gunner brand for everyday computing/gaming.After putting my glasses on for the first time, I noticed it gave a warm tint to everything I looked at, warm colors are certainly easy on the eyes. I also noticed that after wearing them for a little bit you forget you have them on. I found the Gunnar's very comfortable to wear for hours on end barely realizing they're there.After an hour or so the colors begin to look normal again, me being colorblind I actually found it easier to determine rare quality drops which are orange in borderlands vs the yellow and green that drop for the other item types. I played BF3 for a little bit and target locking appeared to be easier, it gives games the right amount of tint to distinguish structures and enemies a little easier.I also used em for surfing and watching movies, by the end of the day I noticed my eyes weren't as tired. I can honestly say, I recommend them to anyone who spends a fair amount of time on their computer.	0
496	Underwhelming	I've been trying various higher-end routers of late, with the Netgear 1600 being the latest candidate.  Compared to comparable ASUS and Linksys models, the connection strength is noticeably weaker, and the software capabilities more rudimentary.  The Netgear software lacks the capability to program access schedule by individual device (which both ASUS & Linksys have) and to prioritize by device (which Linksys has).  Disappointing.	1
497	works like charm and as expected	Fast shipping, easy put into the laptop, works well and as expected, so no complains so far. I would recommend it	0
498	TP-LINK TL-WN722N - Onkyo NR1010	Works perfect with my Onkyo NR1010 receiver! Total plug and play! Hooked right up, latched onto my WiFi and that was it. perfect!	0
499	I love my tablet!	I have not had my tablet very long, but I am already adjusting to it, I have found it to be very easy to use, although I can still draw a little better with a pencil. It makes coloring with photoshop much easier, and is a great tool for those of us without enough money for a larger tablet or a tablet PC.	0
500	A Fantastic Buy and Great Sound	"After at least a year and a half of using other Sony and Shure ear buds, plus noise canceling earphones, I found these in my travel pack last week. I don't know why they were stowed instead of in use: the sound is the best of the ear-buds that I own, and they are the least expensive.To address a couple of other people's concerns, I find these ear buds to be very comfortable. However, unlike the others that I have, these don't come with different sizes. They either fit - in which case, you'll find them very comfortable even after four or five hours of listening - or they won't, in which case, you're not going to like these at all. And I can't tell you whether I have ""average"" ears or that compared to Dumbo, they're small. I guess ""medium"" is the best way to explain size. I always use the middle set of buds that come with others.As for sound, everything is relative even to audiophiles whether they admit it or not. I found that for ear buds, YOU set the equalizer on your computer or iRiver or iPod or iDon'tKnowWhatElse. The ear buds either can  do a good job with these settings or you'll get static, breakups, muffling, etc. So, if this is a problem, cut down on the treble. Bass hasn't been a problem at all, but that too is a matter of preference.I like the fact that, though I can be in a world of my own, if someone calls to me, I can hear them. I can also hear traffic when walking.To prove how much I like these, I just ordered two more pair. Why? Because in this world, I'm always afraid that the manufacturers will stop making something I really like. (It's like the iRiver 4 GB player, probably the last AAA battery operated MP3 player ever.)"	0
501	nice range-adder	I usually travel by motorcycle, so available space for storage is minimal. I use this mostly when in a hotel with advertised wireless, but I'm in a relatively dead spot with my netbook (ASUS eeePC900). It uses a bit more battery than the built-in wireless, but it can sure speed up the connection. I wish it would fold up to a smaller package, but when the connection is weak, it makes an immediately noticeable difference.	1
502	Thank you	My LDP monitor is so much brighter now.  I can see details that I was missing from my older lamp.	0
503	Very Good Midrange Compact Camera	This is an excellent choice in a mid-range compact camera.  The camera works flawlessly, with auto focus, menu negotiation, and picture quality all excellent.  Uploading images to the computer is easy.  The widest angle isn't all that wide though, and the 3X zoom is somewhat limiting; for example if you want to zoom in on your child playing at the playground at a bit of a distance.  Video quality is also excellent; only problem is again the zoom: it's set - and won't move - once you start shooting.  In conclusion, this is a very good mid-range camera: it takes excellent quality pictures and video.  However, the zoom's limitations also limit the camera somewhat; but then again, a more versatile zoom could only be found on a more expensive camera, and if this isn't that important considering your needs, then this would be an excellent reliable camera, and an excellent value.	1
504	Feels really cheap.  Activity light is too bright and big.	I have owned or handled close to 10 different USB drives and this one feels the cheapest.  If this were to be in a loose pocket and I were to sit on it, I am not so sure it would survive.  It has a very light and cheap feeling case.I also to not like the color of the activity light.  Plus it is too bright and big.  It lights up the whole white retracting switch an orangish red color.  I use this for my USB mp3 player in my car and it is a little bright at night.	1
505	ipod case	I bought this for my grandaughter and she really loves it.It is heavy enough , in case she drops it. I would buy from this seller again.	0
506	Major upgrade for computer speakers	Computer speakers used to fall in two categories: tiny tinny-sounding plastic boxes or the bass-heavy gaming speakers. But as we listen more and more to music stored on a computer or watch streaming movies on a computer, better and more accurate sound becomes more important. I also happen to do video editing and music production. I already own a pair of high-end monitors, but I was looking for a second pair that was not too large and would not be overly expensive. The M-Audio AV40 powered speakers are excellent near-field monitors, well-built with accurate and clear sound and the volume is more than adequate. While flat-screen TV's are getting thinner and less expensive, their sound is unfortunately becoming less impressive. Clearly the laws of physics are at work here. I sometimes connect my AV-40's to a display and suddenly the sound quality matches the image quality. The balanced TRS jacks are not only a nice touch, but a must-have when you connect these speakers to a small semi-pro 4-chan mixing panel that fits just on top of the speakers. Suddenly you have a functional and great sounding audio-rig. I tried to find flaws by listening to classical, jazz, rock and blues but I could not find any. Read the included booklet on speaker placement and your results will be impressive as well.	0
507	Not the real deal.  Immitation. Not OEM.	These are not OEM (original equipment manufacturer sony headphones) as stated in the description.  Some people bought these thinking they are, but they are clearly not.  These are nock offs and not the real original headphones.  The material is different and size smaller.  They fit MDR V6, but the material is different,its smaller, and less comfortable.  I'll stick with my worn out ones until I get some genuine ones.I found some genuine, straight from sony!Go to Sony.com[...]enter part# to search :  2-115-668-036.49/each+ 6.95 shipping	1
508	Works great	I ran out of USB ports on my iMac so I got this--the non-powered USB splitters are pretty useless in my experience--So far very happy with the product--does what it said it would do--compact, lots of ports--'nuff said	0
509	It worked	I was quoted $50 for a universal power cord at Best Buy, as they said the market no longer made/supported the Toshiba Satellite A105.I didn't believe him. So I came home and looked for the power cord I needed here on Amazon. I found it - and for about 1/4 of the price I was quoted at the store. I'm very please with this product and purchase!	0
510	Doesn't work with brand new HP	This cable just produces snow on my TV.  No way for me to tell if my video card would support this without buying it.  Waste of money for me.	1
511	Doesn't appear to be what was advertised	This doesn't seem to be the same product I thought it was based on the description. Instead of 5, 10, 15 minute loops, it offers 1, 2, 3 minute recording loops. Its supposed to automatically do low-light recording, but even in a well-lit parking garage I couldn't see anything on the video, just heard audio.Worst of all, when I plugged in the dedicated car-power supply the unit automatically goes into the computer-connected mode - only allowing computer camera or mass storage options - neither of which allows me to record video as I drive. This unit is specifically supposed to power on when you start the car - based on the unit being plugged into the cigarette lighter so the unit knows when power is applied.I haven't found a way to contact the seller yet to find out what remedy they might offer.	1
512	I don't use the Smart Hub and for me it is a ridiculous waste ...	I don't use the Smart Hub and for me it is a ridiculous waste to add to a TV today, but I have to say the picture is absolutely stunning.I also don't care about the voice commands or the camera or any of the bells and whistles.  I only care about the quality of the picture and it really shines.I can't believe they aren't going to make plasma TVs any longer and we'll be stuck with ugly LCD TVs until OLED and other technologies mature.Get this TV while you can if you want a truly beautiful picture, because it's your last chance.	0
513	Good quality for the price	Bought this cable to connect my PC to my home entertainment receiver.  The cable has good flexibility and the connectors are solidly attached to the cables.	0
514	Very Pleased	"My Fujitsu Lifebook (which I loved!) died on me w/a shorted out motherboard that was impossible to access to fix (w/out the help of few $100s just to open her up).  I found it just easier to purchase a new notebook than repair.Yes, the Powerbook was an expensive purchase.  In retrospect, a 12"" probably would have been fine.  I also don't know that I need the DVD burner - but I have it.The speed is great.  Th 80G is nice.  The screen is superb.  Resolution is wonderful.  Set-up was a breeze, as was connection to my pre-existing wireless network.  As always, Apple's packaging and design are flawless.  The keyboard is wonderful (and I like the backlighting).Testing out iDVD was fun.  'Star Wars' looked great on the screen (ok, maybe a 12"" wouldn't have cut it for something like that).  Still lot more features to play with (iMovies, iPhoto, etc) that I won't/don't use everyday....but fun to have.Security is pretty sound - and was even talked out of purchasing a virus pack by the folks @ the Apple Store.Though I had an early version of a Mac, it's taking a bit of time to reacclimate to a non-windows unit.  I have some issues w/the Mac version of Office - but that is for a software review later.Ok - so why only 4 Stars?  I've decided it's very tough to give technology prodcuts 5 stars.  I've done so in the past and been burned.  But I've also decided not to review them immeidately anymore also.  Had the Powerbook 2 mos and very happy w/it.  In my mind - 5 star worthy.  In print - I'll hedge my bets and stick w/ 4."	0
515	Creative Headset	I have gifted this to my friend. According to him, the performance is okay but the appearance and look need to be improved	1
516	great	hub is great opportunity to extended USB connection on you laptop, when I need more than 2 USB electronic to connect	0
517	A good cable	The cable has the feel of a quality product. It has some flex (pliable) to it so it can be routed around objects without fear of cracking the outer jacket.	0
518	Sturdy	It does what it's supposed to do: transfer data. I have it plugged-in between myAirPort Extreme 802.11n routerand myBrother Printer MFC8710DW Wireless Monochrome Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax, providing a full wireless interface. The printer has wireless capabilities built-in, but I prefer this method.The molding around the cable ends feels solid and secure, which would help to contribute to the cable's life. No disappointment here. I would recommend Mediabridge.	0
519	Good Unit for Simple Surveillance	Have three d-link cameras (two day/night-vision, and this one), and this one works the best of all.Picture is good, and mic is very sensitive, picks up nearly every sound nearby.If it had night-vision, I think it would be the best all-around indoor stationary camera that d-link could make (932L is the &#34;upgraded&#34; night-vision version of this one, I suppose (?), but I have that one as well and it doesn't come near the same quality of sight that this unit has).	0
520	nice Little tv	this vizio is nice Looking,made pretty solid,picture quality is good and sound quality is excellent for a tv this small,i did however return this for a larger 24 inch E241-A1 which came DOA ! most likely because Amazon did not double box and UPS people throw things around like its a frisbee ! or i happened to pick a rotten apple from the factory,maybe i will reorder if i see many good review otherwise i go Panasonic	1
521	Not much to say...	I ordered these for my 74 year old father who still likes to make cassette tape mixes.  I was just pleased that I was able to find them.	0
522	"Very difficult to slide fold into ""cradle""; requires both hands with much effort."	Although the description of the product makes it seem that the cradle is very flexible and will accommodate almost any phone, even with a protective cover, I found it extremely difficult to get my Galaxy Samsung S3 in it's cover into the cradle. And even when I did manage to do so, it wasn't always seated properly.	1
523	No Good If You Connect More than One External Hard Drive	This hub is having a lot of problem handling a combination of devices such as iPod and external hard drives while they are all connected.I often need to connect two or three external hard drives to this hub to consolidate the files into a 320GB external drive.  The hub does not provide enough power to have more that 3 of its 7 ports connected, and when used with external drives, you will see that at least one of the external drives (depending on how many drives are connected) would continuously connect and disconnect until the number of USB ports used is decreased by disconnecting some devices.I bought 2 and both behave identically, so if you want to use several external hard drive and perhaps hook up your iPod at the same time, you should look else where, this hub will disappoint you.	1
524	Good price for Good camera	At the Gold box price deal it is a good purchase. Do not like the confusing menu setting under &#34;effect&#34;. Anti-vibration functonality could be better. Rest is OK and pictures are nice. Like the optical zoom capability very much.Normally use a EOS 5D semi-professional camera with 12 MP, but this 16MP makes nice walking around shots if you do not want to carry the 10 pound camera and lenses with you.	0
525	I'm sure it is great	But now I have returned the only device I had that used this kind of micro chip so I will not be able to render an opinion until I get some other device that uses these. I will hand on to it for future use!	0
526	Very handy	Very handy to have . Though now that I have this one, I'm considering that perhaps I should get a longer one, but this one is quite functional.	0
527	Surprising Power	I bought this item (Anker 18W/3.6A Wall Charger) to keep an extra charger around for my Samsung 7 inch tablet. I like to read in my favorite chair and I also like to keep the battery charged while reading. I have a charge monitor app on the tablet and the wimpy usb chargers I have are just not up to the task of charging the tablet while reading or doing anything else.Enter the Anker 3.6 amp usb charger. There are two ports on this charger and I tested the tablet on both ports while having a book reading app open. I realize that this is not much of a workout for the tablet but this is a regular activity for me and a place to plug in the charger is nearby. The ports are labeled and I switched between them while checking the battery monitor app and sure enough the port that is labeled for the Apple products was putting out 2.2 amps. The specs call for 2.1 but I won't gripe about an extra tenth of an amp. The charger maintained the full amperage while charging a backup battery that I carry in the car at the same time with no loss of power to the tablet and not even getting hot. Very surprising even if that is what they claim for this charger.This is a real quality appearing item but needs to have the labels indicating what port was where in a contrasting color because they are very hard to see. That is not enough of a problem to knock off points considering the great performance of the charger.I am going to purchase an Anker charger like this for my cars based on the quality and power of the unit I have now.Well worth the money spent.PS: I am sorry for no Amazon link to the charger but the Amazon link that says it is for this item is taking me to the automotive type chargers so here is a link to the product on the Anker website if Amazon allows it - [...]	0
528	Works Perfectly!	This cable works great. You have to get one if you own a Kindle HD. I used it to hook my kindle fire HD to the TV for movies (and games). After many tries with other products this one is the ONLY one that worked for me.I liked the 10' length and for the price, you can't go wrong. I have seen similar cables at Best Buy for way more. This cable is extremely sturdy and very well built. I will probably purchase all of my cabling from this seller in the future.	0
529	I like this useful item!	This is an item I really like having. I own five computers and work on them myself whenever there's a problem or they need upgrading. This little kit keeps all the necessary tools in one place. The case is just big enough to also store my anti-static wrist band. Everything I need to work on my computers is in there. When I' don't need it the case is compact and easy to store. The price is reasonable too. I recommend it to anyone who works on computers.	0
530	It works	"When it comes to non-OEM batteries for Panasonic cameras, the $64,000.00 question is always: ""IS IT COMPATIBLE?!!!"" And the answer with regard to this particular battery is: ""Yes. It is"". I have a Lumix ZS8, with the original Firmware version 1.0 (there have been no firmware updates for the ZS8). I wasn't sure if that was going to be a good thing or not -- there's just know way of knowing in advance. But this battery works in the OEM charger, and it works in the camera, and the price is a fraction of the cost of an OEM Panasonic battery. I'm a happy camper. The fact that the battery I received is 950mAh, and the picture shows a 1000mAh battery, is basically a non-issue for me. The OEM is 895mAh, so the 950mAh is at least its equal in that regard. I haven't tried shooting with the new battery in the camera yet, so if there's anything out of the ordinary, I'll update this review at that point. I do know that on Saturday I shot over 280 pictures w/o flash with the OEM battery, and the battery status indicator never moved from 3 bars. So I think I have a pretty good idea of what the original battery can do. And once I get all those photos processed, I'll put in this new battery and see what it can do. For me, the main thing was compatibility. Now that I know it's compatible, I don't expect it to perform any less than the OEM, but again...you never know. It came with a little plastic cover to protect the contacts, which I appreciated. Shipping from BestDealUSA was a little on the slow side (7 days from ordering it to receiving it, compared to a similar order from another seller that came in 3 days), but it was within the parameters of the Amazon arrival date range, so it's not that big of a deal either. However, since there are several vendors who sell the same item, you might want to consider another vendor if shipping time is important to you."	0
531	Some  negatives	I agree with the reviewers that the features are great. However, cheaper products in this line include the ball head. So it seems overpriced. If you need the specialty feet, the option to add a weight to the center, or want to attach the camera upside down then the cost is not a factor. If you don't have a need for these extras, then you should look at other tripods. I showed the unit to some high-end amateurs and these were part of their comments. They also showed me an aluminum tripod that was almost identical in weight. So if the extra cost relates to the carbon fiber then it may not be necessary. I'm guessing that this unit is intended for the professionals and the extra $100-$200 to have the features, quality, and ruggedness is not even a consideration.There was only a large screw sticking out of the top of the tripod. It was too large for any of my cameras or camcorders to attach to. Had I read the manual (but who reads manuals these days) I would have discovered that the screw was reversible. It had a smaller screw head on the other end that did fit my cameras and camcorders. I only discovered this when I went to Vanguard's web site and watched a video that explains the features of the Vanguard Auctus Plus 323CT Tripod.	1
532	Excellent so for	So this may be a little premature of a review, but I got this unit last night and popped in an 8GB SD card from Amazon basics.The unit was plug and play with my computer(Windows 7), and opened up the SD card so I could load some music on it for my new car stereo head unit.It worked like a charm and is nice and small so it easily sits on my computer desk.  The attatched USB cord is only about 2 - 3 inches long, but comes with a longer adapter cord.All in all I am very pleased with this card reader, but I've only used it once so far.Will update with durability issues in the next few weeks/months, or if I have any issues.	0
533	High quality switch for the price	Since I only had one port to work with, I purchased two of these which were a must. These units are about half the price Radio Shack is selling them for.	0
534	Good Sound for the money!	I installed a lot of speakers in my time for this price it's hard to find anything to compete in my opinion....	0
535	Good enclosure.	A very good enclosure for up to a 1 TB hard drive. It is light weight and easy to assemble.	0
536	Switch box with some issues	First I have to say that this box does exactly what it is designed to do; switch between various RCA inputs. However, there are two problems with this device. First and the biggest problem is video distortion. Your video will get distorted if the screen you are watching is mostly white. I believe this was reported by a reviewer or two and I can confirm that this is a problem. It is most annoying when you watch a movie where there are scenes in Heaven or when a character is reading a short note (lots of white paper, little text). If you can live with that then this may be a good product for you. On a related note, in all other scenes or scenes where there is only a little bit of white there is no loss of quality in the images.The second problem is the remote. It has an odd shape and it doesn't always work. You have to find the sweet spot (or angle) to get it to hit the sensor just write before the box will switch inputs. Also, mind stopped functioning all together a little after a year of owning the product. The box is still working fine, but the remote has been gone for a while.Overall, I would recommend purchasing a different product if you can find one that you like in your price range. I have already started doing this myself and have some prospects that look just as good and didn't cost as much.	1
537	Portable, rugged, and designed for ease of use	"CURRENT VERSION OF PRODUCTI am editing my review to deal with the latest version of this product. My earlier review, below, was for a previous version. I also received a review sample in return for an unbiased review.This is a USB 3.0 port multiplier, or ""hub."" It is passive design, meaning it isn't externally powered and so shares available power, which comes from your PC/laptop, among the four ports. USB 3.0 provides a total of about 0.75 Amps. This makes the hub best used with passive or low power devices. It's fine for a small webcam, separately powered USB audio, separately powered hard drives, USB sticks, etc. It's not really for things like DVD burners that rely on USB power. This is entirely typical for such hubs.Like its predecessor, it's lightweight, sleek, and relatively small, but not so small that the ports are crowded together. There's no problem with trying to get USB cables to fit. Like the earlier version, all the ports are on the front of the hub. This is a major convenience and avoids having wires go every which-way. Unlike the earlier version, the ports are angled down slightly rather than up slightly. This make the unit a little smaller but it was definitely more convenient to have the ports angled up.The other difference is in the connecting cable supplied with the unit. The big improvement is that the supplied cable is long enough and really solid and substantial. It is likely to last a long time with ordinary care. The disadvantage is that the cable is USB to micro-B, a 3.0 standard. This cable is less common than USB to USB, so if you have to replace it, you'll end up spending a little more. Fortunately, you're unlikely to need to replace it unless you lose it. And if you're using this in a portable manner, you'll have one more cable that you have to carry along with you.But all in all, despite a couple of design changes, there is no reason to deviate from my 5-star rating. There is a lot of value and convenience in this hub. I prefer it for use in a fixed position, with a desktop PC, but it's very portable and can go in your laptop case with ease.EARLIER VERSION OF PRODUCTI'm not sure why this is branded as a ""Mac"" product because it's a USB hub that will work with a Mac or PC running either Windows or Linux. Hardly any surprises there ... maybe because it has a nice appearance?This is a 4-port USB hub, powered by the host. You use it as you would expect ... as a port multiplier; plug it into any USB 2.0 port and you end up with four ports instead of one; but you don't end up with four times the charging/running power, you end up with typically 1/4 the power per port. Not an issue if you use these things as intended, with power passive devices such as a mouse, keyboard, thumb drive, etc. Maybe not the best if you want to use a big external hard drive.But there's nothing new in all this; all passive USB hubs work this way. So why choose (or not choose) this one?What I like about it is that it's rugged (aluminum case) but still lightweight. What is really good about the design, though, is that it sits flat and exposes the four ports in front and on a slight upward angle (see the product photos on the product page). This makes it *really* easy to access especially if you plug it into a front port on your desktop computer (or just about any port on a laptop). All the cables will exit in the same direction and you won't have the kind of tangle you sometimes get with the really tiny hubs that have ports on all sides.There are plastic 4-port hubs that are a little smaller and a little lighter, but really not a lot of difference, so if you want a portable hub to throw in your briefcase or backpack, this one will work fine. Be careful with the cable lead, of course, and this will last you a long time.In the end I decided to use it with my desktop, because of the aforementioned manner in which it sits flat and is easy to access. But I might just get another one for my briefcase and ditch the flimsy plastic unit I carry now.Disclaimer: I received a sample for review, but I write unbiased and uninfluenced reviews."	0
538	perfect	Wish this model had built in wifi. This model i like better than the other because it boots faster. Wish it would adapt to open source products to give user creativity option to help mold the next WD box.	0
539	This ain't no NS10 or AR2, but it's a great-sounding good value that the kids love	This audiophile looks for true fidelity and a flat frequency curve.  I also look for the best values in audio.  I am cautiously trusting of third party reviews.  And I was in the market for one of these animals for my pre-teen son.This speaker surely must take advantage of today's &#34;Class T&#34; amplifier technology.  The amp sounds clean and powerful and efficient, and extraordinarily loud given its diminutive measurements and compact battery.The driver itself has a slight tinny edge to it that is fully expected from a unit its size, but this is not to detract from an overall positive review.  In fact, I was genuinely surprised at how much more low end was present once the bellow was expanded.Face it - you're not gonna get a flat curve outta one of these, but then, that's not the point.  The point is value.  This unit is very well built, has all the Bluetooth control goodies on it, never fails to connect to its source, collapses into a tiny puck that is easy to throw into a purse or pocket, has plenty of reasonably-balanced gain, and a price tag that ultimately is unbeatable.  My kid loves it unconditionally.Basically, this thing is a party in your pocket.  This audiophile is pragmatic enough to recognize that, for that alone, it deserves all five stars.	0
540	Quality	Every thing about this PS was quality. The packaging was far better than it was for the video card or motherboard I ordered. The cables were all sheathed and of adequate length and types. The fan is quiet. For some reason they even include a cloth bag. It's much improved over the Antec PS I bought last time.	0
541	Plug and Play	Popped it in the laptop and installed the operating system and i was good to go. Its really that simple	0
542	Portability and so light!	UI was pleasantly surprised by how light this drive actually is. I've had it for a month so far and no problems. I don't even remember it's in my bag. I'll have to get another (bigger) one in the near future!	0
543	Another one of those mediocre lense	When I bought Nikon 50mm 1.4, believing into so much hype, I had a real high hopes, turned out to be a major disappointment; its output wasn't much better than their popular push-pull zoom lens.  Buy prime lens for image quality, and the zooms for convenience.  I mostly blamed at my technique, even spent a fortune to setup with the state-of-art darkroom processing equipment; why couldn't I produce image at par with some other photographers do..., but never blamed on crappy yet highly over-hyped Nikon gears, until someone showed image mostly taken with Contax gear.  The 5x7 printed output produced from that little range finder type camera, I believe it was G2, just unforgettable, never seen anything like it, nowhere in the same class as Nikon junks I was so used to; image doesn't need to be printed on a gigantic paper to be noticeable.  One B&W; candid shot of a typical looking female I saw just can't get it out of my mind even after 20-30 years later, but then, Nikon junkies have nothing to say of prime subject but always touting on background, saying how beautifully Nikon lens blurs out to area of distortion... this has to be the comic of new age.  Then the owner explained, Nikon are for inexperienced amateurs who couldn't careless for its output, but the serious photographer won't touch Nikon with 10-foot pole... Why spend so much time investing learning photography and settle for junks like Nikon?  Nikon is like GM of America, everyone knows its brand, but no one really likes them, especially those who have prior experiences with its brand.  It's not like Sloan has risen from grave to revive GM to its former glory.It's crazy to spend $500 for this lens, known to producing lukewarm images, and performs far worse than their line of zoom lens.	1
544	excellent speaker for the money	I was really amazed at the sound of these little speakers.  Especially when you consider the price!  Not Bose quality, but definitely not Bose price!	0
545	Get 'em	Good quality cables for half the price of WalMart's OK quality cables.  Good deal.	0
546	Great for laptops	I ended up buying 3 of them for myself, my son and for a friend.  They use Apple laptops, but still need the precision of an external mouse.  I use mine for traveling with my small netbook.	0
547	Works great	I wish I could write more but I can't. This card works perfectly. I never have a problem. I use it on a Canon camera, and a Lexar card reader.	0
548	Works Great	After reviewing an install website online it went in without a hitch.  Finding the best location to set the module (I placed it under the shifter) and where in the the console you want the wires to come out ( I did the top, a little hard to pull and push back slack) will be your biggest issues.  No problems with performance afterwards.	1
549	Outstanding for the iPhone	"Finding the right headphone for the iPhone can be a little challenging because of its awkward-size headphone input jack. I had previously bought the more popular V-MODA VIBE Duo Nero (w/call button). The audio was good, but not enough to justify the $100 upgrade over the stock headphone. My old Sony MDR-EX71 paired with the Shure Music Phone Adapter sounded almost as good as the V-Moda in terms of bass level. I returned it after a week partly because of hearing durability issues about the earphone. I then seriously contemplated on getting the Ultimate Ears super.fi 5Pro, but opted for the Shure because of the triple driver technology and the iPhone cable adapter that compliments it. I'm hardly an audiophile, but I can say that the sound reproduction is exceptionally clean. Basia's ""Copernicus"" with its rich jazzy instruments was a delight to hear and Enrique Iglasias' ""Bailamos"" bass-thumping tune was intense with absolutely no distortion.In short, if you're budget-minded, get the Ultimate Ears super.fi 5Pro, but if you can afford or crazy enough to shell out this kind of money on one of the best headphones on the market, look no further."	0
550	Very handy.	These adapters are really handy for tight places or to simply change the routing/positioning of your Toslink cables.  The connectors are VERY secure and the fact that they swivel makes these superior to the fixed angle variants.  No sound quality issues.  Highly recommended.	0
551	Almost Perfect	The WD 2TB external hard drive is an excellent backup drive. I gave it only four stars due to trouble with Mac initialization. Following the instructions to the letter, it still took several times before the drive was properly initialized. Since then the drive has worked flawlessly on both my iMac and Macbook.The cost per gigabyte for mine was just $0.06 (with free Amazon shipping). Compare that to $0.07/GB for the 1TB and 1.5TB, and $0.14/GB for the 500GB drives and you can see just how cheap it is. I don't have a huge photo collection, nor do I store a lot of music or movies on my computer, so 2TB should last me for quite awhile.I've had WD hard drives in PCs that I have owned and have never had any trouble with them, so I have no reason to believe that my experience will be any different this time. This drive takes up little space on the desktop, is absolutely quiet at all times, and gets barely warm to the touch even when copying large quantities of files.For tons of space at a low price I don't think you can beat this drive.Update: After four months the drive is still as good as I said above. Since my Iomega 500 GB drive just died (after about a year-and-a-half) I've decided to buy another WD 2TB drive. Another plus: the price has gone down since June, when I bought my first one.	0
552	Fantastic router.. works well with Time Warner in southern CA	It has been about 6 weeks since I installed it with Time Warner broadband's 15mbps connection. It has been working very well since, and I've never had to reboot it. The speed is very consistent as well. Saving about $5 of the stupid modem rental fee every month now. No complaints what so ever.	0
553	Big and Quiet	I love this fan.I use it primarily to blow dust and animal hair away from my computer tower's grill (an odd use perhaps, but it is quite effective at pushing larger debris (like hair) away before the intake behind the grill pulls the debris into the computer case itself.)I have had it for several months.I am impressed by its power.I am impressed by its very low noise level. It is not silent, but the hum is extremely low.I could see using this as a very effective personal fan.The USB retractable cable is strong, very flexible, and it retains its spring-action.Although the product description provides accurate measurements, it is bigger than I had expected. In my case, this was not an issue.Thermaltake is a very strong brand in the computer parts industry.I hope this helps!	0
554	Solid, reliable, inexpensive TV with decent 720p picture	"Few would consider a 50"" TV as a secondary TV, but for those who do, this is the perfect TV for you.  The picture isn't going to blow you away and it has noticeable flaws in the darker tones and refresh rates, but if you're looking for a clean, solid picture at a great price, you're going to get it with this Panasonic.  You're also going to get a TV that's got a decent set of features and is easy to use with universal remotes, thanks to a fairly intelligent user interface.  It is easy to quickly and accurately switch inputs, and set up more advanced features like auto-dimming when the ambient light goes dark.  The location of all the input ports, and number of HDMI ports makes connectivity very simple and complete.  If picture quality is secondary to size, you'll probably want to go 720p vs 1080p, and at $599 with free delivery and no sales tax, it was a ridiculous bargain and one that cannot be matched."	0
555	Light weight and sturdy	The lens cover is very light weight and has sturdy construction. When the lens it is attached to is not in use, the lens hood can be reverse attached for easy storage with the lens.	0
556	No ability to change orientation, If PC sleeps Android takes over.	As a monitor it is OK. As an android Device it is limited. No ability rotate the device (which really limits what apps you can use) are deal breakers.I will do a full review with video later, but it won't be positive.  I really wanted to like this.	1
557	Good product	These fit my MDR-V6's perfectly. They are MUCH more comfortable than the leatherette ones that are stock. If you need replacements for your cans, these are the ones.	0
558	works with non-WD external HDDs well	"I replaced a different media player with the WDTV Live Hub recently and overall had a really good experience.Pros:1) it's really small - the 1TB HDD is 2.5"" and NOT 3.5"" surprisingly2) the two USB ports support non-WD branded external HDDs well. It's USB 2.0, but recognizes a 3TB 3.5"" HDD fine3) product works well including the software4) plays well with Windows 7 for transferring files to the internal HDD via ethernet/sharedCons:1) remote is really clunky design wise - the Logitech Harmony works well though2) connecting a computer via ethernet to the internal HDD transfer speed is slow - slower than USB2.0"	1
559	Quality oozes from it.	Flexibility allows better, longer lasting connections.  Hold it and you can feel the quality.  Not a cheap mass produced Radio S---k or WalM--t knockoff.  If this what you need then this is the one to get.	0
560	great product for price.	I have always trusted the SANDISK brand for valuable data.  This was ordered for my tablet and again, great size and quality for the price.	0
561	Not quite Plug and Play for Windows XP	After finding out that, 1: I had to push the SD card in all the way until it is flush with the edge, and 2: (since I'm using Windows XP) also install a patch from Microsoft to support the exFAT file system of SDXC (Wikipedia has the link for the patch. Just search for SDXC), I was able to get this to work. Patch install takes several minutes.End result with Windows XP and USB 2.0 backward compatibility? Probably about the same read/write speed (16.5 MBytes/sec) that I was getting with a Blueprotron SDHC reader. But since the extra card capacity means I can backup without time wasting compression I will likely save time overall.	0
562	Good price, easy to use, works exactly as expected	"I bought this product to reformat a 3.5"" SATA laptop hard drive. Right out of the box it was easy to connect the HD to my computer with this adapter. I was able to reformat quickly and with no hassles whatsoever. This is an incredibly functional product. I would recommend it to anyone."	0
563	For the bike tools...	I use this to hold and keep all my bike tools all together in my messenger bag. It's awesome and elastics are strong, so your stuff won't go away. In addition (I think it's not shown in the amazon pics), in the behind of that it has a very small zippered pocket, where you can store papers and small items.	0
564	Almost imperceptible volume	Though cheap, this earpiece does not seem worth buying for a RAZR V3 phone. Its volume so low that makes it useless to the average man. Thinking that I had a flawed headset, I asked the merchant for a replacement. The replacement had the exact same problem. Yes, I know about the volume control on the phone, but the max volume was still imperceptible. There is also a software you can download which enables you to hack the gain on the cell phone. This procedure is complicated enough that I do not recommend it for most casual computer users. Also, shouldn't the manufacturer just get the simple problem of volume right?The original headset made by Motorola had better build quality than this item, though the dimensions are more or less the same. I notice other reviewers complained about the size of the earpiece. My understanding is that the earpiece is not meant to fit in your ear canal, but outside of it.Two stars for the merchant's willingness to ship a second headset, though it took a week for them to get around to processing my request.	1
565	SUPER product!	This drive is GREAT!Pros:Small size but with giant capacityThere is a LED lightNo cover to lose, its a slider cover where the cover slides down to protect the usb adapterUSB 3.0 / 128GB at a great priceCons:PlasticI did 2 tests with Lan speed test writing and reading a 100MB fileOn USB2.0 port on my dell xps, I get:~24MB/s Write~27MB/s ReadOn Macbook Pro USB 3.0, I get:~80MB/s write~192MB/s readLets see how long it last...(Update) been using it half year and still going strong.... will update again later..	0
566	I like it.	I bought this camera for a pocket, take it anywhere. It takes greatpictures, just the right size for a small camera for my hands. Despitethis, i have dropped it twice, once on pavement, once on concrete. Tomy amazement, it survived unscathed both times. Can't guarantee theseresults, but I am pleased. Only drawback I see is it is mediocre onbattery life. Highly recommended.	1
567	Expensive ,	I bought this router refurbished in $100 from Cisco website. Out of box it worked fine except range was terrible. I mean it was unable to cover 2bed room apartment. I was thinking of buying Asus , but then I thought let's try ddwrt . ddwrt for this router is premature but it solved the range issue by increasing the transmit range. It is working better now.I will use it until I have money for Asus and am not buying a router with internal antennas again.	0
568	Worked great for me - Galaxy S2 Epic	As per other's instructions, I inserted it in a powered-off phone and let the phone format it (automatic, after a yes/no dialog). I removed it from the phone and copied  my old card onto it through a card reader on the PC (plus about 20 movies) and everything is working perfectly. Speeds seem outstanding; certainly, copying a 3GB HD movie I copied from my Blu-Ray disc took only a few minutes, even over USB 2.0.	0
569	Very useful	Is very useful it is build with good materials to protect the tablet and have an elegant design for business man and students.	0
570	Had to buy two in order for it to work,	I used it for my Rode Video Mic but I found out that one of these screw things doesn't work. You need a second one with the additional washer to tightly mount a shoe mount. After getting a second one it works great, sucks that this doesn't come with any instructions and that you have to get two.	1
571	Barely functional....	Basically this makes a good carry case, but for the Iconia to work well, you have to remove it because it tends to overlap the screen which disables how you can access Windows 8 functions involving dragging.	1
572	Plenty of room and pockets	This bag is nice, well constructed and fits well when all straps are adjusted.  I got this bag as a part of my D 5100 purchase just today and will serve me well while I am in the USA doing picture things; however,I am leaving for China, Thailand, and Vietnam in a few months and will be bringing my laptop, camera, and backpack.  There is no place for my laptop in this case, (if it was just a little bigger) so I will be buying another case for my camera and laptop while traveling overseas and wear it on my front while the backpack will sit on my back.  Overall a great case especially since I didn't pay for it. (lol)	0
573	Excellent quality bag	Excellent quality bag. This is great if you like to travel light. The padding on the strap is curved which doesn't make sense to me but whatever.	0
574	Mediabridge Ultra HDMI 3ft	I bought 4 of these as a gift to my retired aunt and uncle who finally went digital with FIOS for their home. They have one hd tv, but are in the market for 3 more and I wanted to get quality hdmi cables that would handle any tv purchased in the next couple of years. This Ultra Series is the latest version of hdmi cables and will handle ethernet, 3D, audio return as well as hd digital tv and at only $10 each. I am a longtime customer of Mediabridge and always look to them to provide the very best quality at a good price for audio, video and computer cables. Highly recommend you try them, you'll be glad you did.	0
575	Very Handy	Works great. These things are tiny! It's a good thing they have loops to attach them to keychains or lanyards.	0
576	Awesome speaker system!!	Honestly, I was skeptical that a $42 speaker system could be much good.  I'm fairly picky when it comes to video and audio quality, and I was nothing short of amazed when I hooked this system up.  The bass response was so strong that I even had to turn it down a little (and I like a lot of bass).  I would buy it again in a heartbeat!!	0
577	Perfect for my needs...	I currently use the MicroSD card in my Galaxy SII (i777) phone.  It's primary purpose is pictures for the camera, and it seems to keep up very nicely as the GSII has a fast 8MP camera.  I haven't use the MicroSD to SD card adapter, but the USB stick adapter works very well when I take the MicroSD out of my phone and put it in my WDLive for a quick HD slide show of my pictures.Edit: When using the USB Adapter, I currently use a different MicroSD to SD adapter that I've been using for a while, I just wanted to clarify that.Great Value for the Price	0
578	junk, never worked when recieved	looks and feels very cheap, gaps through the center of the casing and i had to solder a wire to the curcuit board due to a break in a contact on one speaker output, dont know if the video works but using it for audio only, works fine now but thats only because i had to finish the assemble, thought they would be checked in the factory, the rca lead doesnt stay in the sockets, just falls out and that didnt work any way, all three wires on this wire was faulty so binned it, the female rca sockets on each connection are too small so had to really push on it to get it to fit, avoid this and get something that works and is not cheap plastic	1
579	Excellent as advertised...but not for music purists...	Excellent set of headphones for people who listen to music or video only occassionally (2-3X/week), but does have a low hum of static noise that would disturb the afficionado. Great range...I can take this anywhere within 100 to 150 feet and have decent sound. A little bulky and can get heavy on the head after about an hour or two. Good product overall....	1
580	itouch case	Works well and fits well on the itouch. Amazing the markups on these items from retail stores. Always check on Amazon before purchasing from retailers...save 50%+	0
581	Great as usual.	"Just upgraded to a 13"" non-retina Mac Book Pro i7 from a mid 2009 core 2 duo. The machine is speedy and efficient. I'm not surprised, and I'm just delighted. I would strongly recommend a Mac any day over a PC without any doubt. Enough said."	0
582	Great projector for the price, two little cons...	"*** Update 1/15/12 Repair of Dead Pixels ***I ended up having 7 dead pixels (white dots).  I finally sent it back for warranty service.  It took about a month for me to get my projector back, which I'm oked with, but it came back with a big, deep scratch on the top.  I don't think it's my original projector.  I'm pretty upset at that because I had kept my projector in pristine condition - and now it's like an old, used projector.  There are now no dead pixels but the scratch leaves me with a bad taste about the company.  I still think the projector is worth 4 stars, but the service is worth only 2 stars.------------------------------------------------------------------------*** Update ***I have this for almost 12 months now.Had to take a star away because there are now two dead pixels, one kind of dark near the top-center, and one bright, annoying one almost in the middle of the screen.  I'm researching on what can be done to fix this.Other than the two dead pixels, it's still working great.---Original Review------------------------------------------------------Own this for about 2 weeks now.  This is a great projector.Pros:Image is pretty dam cool. Played BR and reg DVD on it.  I love it!Big 110""+ screen.Nice and bright, even in standard mode.Quick start up and shut down.Extra pluses:*the built in speakers sound much better than I would expect.*came with a padded backpack.*The packaging was especially nice. All the sides, top and bottom were wrapped inside some industrial air wrap.  Then it was placed inside the padded backpack.Only two cons:*No horizontal keystone.*3D requires $100 glasses.  I'll need to wait for the prices to come down before investing.I highly recommend this projector for movies and games.  (Also, I plugged it in to a battery backup... a sudden lost of power can jack up a projector.)************PS3, PC, and extra DVD player connected to it via an HDMI switch."	1
583	great	I have had this TV for a couple weeks now. I usually view in a fairly dark room and have not noticed any halo or other anomalies. I'm really happy with it I would give it 5 stars but I haven't done enough critical viewing. I also haven't really toyed with the AMP settings but I wasn't blown away for normal viewing. Everything does look great without it. Oh, my wall color is very dark and I don't really even see the red ToC even during the day which is fine by me.	0
584	This is perfect	I ordered this, but since it's not Prime and it wouldn't get here on time, I went to RadioShack and bought something very similar for $29.95. They didn't have anything cheaper. A few days later this one arrived and they both work just as good. There's absolutely no difference in how they perform. So if you need one of these, just pick this one up for 3 bux and save yourself a ton of cash. It will work just as great as the expensive ones.	0
585	Super upgrade to older stereo, great range	I got this because I was tired of plugging my phone into my stereo to listen to music. With this HomeSpot device, I can now stream with Bluetooth from across the living/dining room and control the music and volume easily.Setting it up was simple: plug it in and connect the mini-mic cable to stereo (comes with both mini-mic and RCA plugs). I searched for BT devices on my phone and it paired the first time (and every other time so far).The range is good; it's working at about 25 feet distance with modest obstacles in the way (a chair and a partial corner in between the phone and receiver). The connection breaks up when I add more obstacles (a complete wall full of appliances), which is to be expected.The only downsides are that it requires yet another fat mini-USB adapter to plug in somewhere, and the device is so light and tiny that the cables pull it and make it difficult to lie flat. Overall, I'm very happy and would gladly buy again.	0
586	Reliable storage.	Eight years ago, I started out with Lexar based on a number of recommendations.  I subsequently bought several more Lexar cards and in all that time, I have never lost an image.  That first 16MB Lexar still works fine.  Other brands may cost less and may work just as well, but my images are too important for me to tempt fate.	0
587	Excellent Value	This camera is awesome for underwater pictures. It is not the best for standard pictures. We went to a water park and I did not want to take my digital camera and took the Kodak EasyShare Sport C123 camera and some of the pictures outside of the water were disappointing. The color is not as vivid. I am still very satisfied with the underwater pictures and highly recommend this camera for that.	0
588	love these	I have been searching for a pair of earbuds and this was the best I found. JVC is known for their audio products and the case that holds it is so convienent......you just wind it up and close the case top.  No more getting the earbuds wrapped around something else in my lunch box (where I keep them)	0
589	headstrap one of my favs.	Always one of my favorite points of views. The quick clip will only work with very thick billed hats and for what I do with fishing I will fling that camera off my head on a normal hat. so the quick clip gets used for a belt clip gopro	0
590	Works as advertised	I installed this as soon as it arrived and it worked flawlessly as advrtised. It  reads all the BD disks that were not able to be read by my PS3 with the old laser and it is still working fine. Would recommend this to anyone with a PS3 that will not read BD disks.	0
591	Fabulous AMD board	"Replaced a MSI board that was DOA with this ASUS board. Added Memory, CPU, DVD and video card and immediately was up and running. This board has a core unlocker feature for AMD multicore chips. Once the system was running well in default mode I turned on the core unlocker and now am running the Phenom 2 core cpu with all 4 cores operational. Very stable over 6 hours of stress test with no overheating, cpu glitches or memory misses.My budget system consists of this board, AMD Phenom X 2 555 BE CPU, SATA HD and 4gb Crucial DDR3 memory. I am very happy with this combo and am getting the performance of a significantly higher priced system.The features this board had that I wanted1. Core unlocker and the ability to tweak CPU and BUS speeds (don't know if I will do that)2. USB 3.03. ATX size board4. One PATA header5. Lots and lots of USB and SATA headers.Only drawback for some might be that the chip-sets are not the latest and greatest and it will not support the upcoming ""bulldozer"" AMD CPUs.If you want a great ATX sized board at a reasonable price and are willing to have one year old tech give this board consideration."	0
592	it will work	I bought this for some quick on location shooting and it seems like it will work just fine.  I do fear that a small gust of wind will take the umbrella and everything else to the ground so if you do use it take a sand bag to keep the stand on the ground.Overall it seems like it will do the job but probably will weaken over time with use.  Good Cheap alternative to studio equipment.	1
593	many issues with this board	I have built a lot of computers over the years and I must say this is one board I would recommend that you not buy. This board has so many problems. The first is the IGD video section. No matter what under certain conditions the video will just disappear and you will get a screen full of multicolored bars. This happens on the HDMI and DVI port REGARDLESS of the BIOS settings and without any settings for enhancing performance. I finally gave up and put a PCI-E graphics adapter in the machine. The on-board LAN port is so unreliable and many times the operating system will not be able to retrieve any configuration from it and even the Intel website driver update program will not even recognize it. I ended up with a PCI-e ethernet card and totally disabling the LAN port on the board. The second x16 PCI-E slot if populated with ANYTHING including a graphics card will cause the system not to even enter the BIOS. The USB 3.0 ports i NEVER made work properly. I did actually get it to boot (never reliably) by disabling the onboard LAN and IGD and using add in cards. I have spent more time messing with this board than any other build. It is setting on my bench right now awaiting a replacement. This board gets thrown in the trash. Oh almost forgot the on-board Marvel secondary SATA controller when enabled causes conflicts that require you disable the IE 1394 and most everything else. I NEVER got the board to work reliably with the 2nd SATA controller enabled.*****UPDATE****My DP67BG arrived today and 30 minutes later I had a perfectly working system. That should tell all.	1
594	Very nice Headset at a reasonable price	I had had it up to here with the noise in my wireless headset.  So I started my search for a corded headset.  I had not started out looking at the Denons but I was getting frustrated at reading reviews of the corded headsets out there.  The ones with great reviews cost $500 and up.  All the headsets under $300 kept getting mixed reviews except the Denons.  So I took a chance and purchased the Denons.I am sure glad I did.  The packaging was very secure but as soon as I felt the product I sort of knew I made a nice choice.  To begin with the cord is a high quality wrapped cord that is very tough and rugged.  The banana jack adapter is not a namby pamby slide on; it screws on for a solid static free connection.The sound is truly remarketable and great to listen to.  I bought the headset for watching movies in the early morning so I would not disturb the family and they just make the movie a breeze to listen to.  All the music, sounds, and dialog are right there for your listening pleasure.  A big bonus is that I am still able to hear the family when they get up and come downstairs.I have the headset paired with A DENON AVR3310C1 that I picked up this past summer on the Deal of the Day.  This combo works well together and exceeds my wildest dreams.	0
595	Very solid value, excellent customer service	I purchased this mount after reading the reviews for using this mount with an Epson 8350.  I took the advice of others in order to locate the balance point of the mount.  Also, like others, I was only able to use 3 of the 5 mounting holes.  However, I was able to mount the projector and it works very well.  It took a little adjusting to get it level and solid but I was able to do it.  I do want to use all 5 mounts as I want to be sure the projector is securely held.  I found the Atdec website and sent a message to customer service asking how I would go about purchasing two additional long extensions.  I was very pleasantly surprised when the customer service representative replied that he would send them to me no charge if I would provide my address.  Now that is outstanding customer service!!!!  Highly recommend this mount!	0
596	Good product for the price	I found this on Amazon for less than what they were selling on their own web page and that made this a good deal.  I get more channels than with the other one I had and most important I get ABC CBS and NBC and that was the goal.	0
597	Excellent firewire Cable	The Belkin F3N402-03-ICE 4-Pin to 4-Pin FireWire Cable  is  a good quality Firewire that I have used several times. This one was three feet long. I plan to buy another one six feet long. This cable is of good quality and works well for me. I certainly recommend this cable.	0

599	iClever Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard... the Pros and Cons... 4 1/2 Stars	"""Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard"" from iClever. This keyboard is priced at $15.99 and is sold on Amazon.com.This device works with Apple (even the original Ipad 1 with OS 5.1.1), Android and Windows based bluetooth enabled units and works with the latest Bluetooth version 3.0Please Note: the company provided me with a free device in exchange for an honest review.Product Dimensions:(WxTxL) 4.7 x 0.2 x 11.2 inchesWt: 11.7 ouncesThis device requires 2 x AAA batteries. (not included)Some thoughts on ""Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard"" by iClever...The Pros:1.) has an attractive appearance with a brushed silver finish.2.a) bluetooth pairing with my IPad/IPhone was done in seconds. Initiated by pressing a small button on the underside.2.b) has a small blue LED light that flashed briefly when turned on. This same small light blinks continually when in the pairing mode.3.) 'chiclet' type keyboard that has a nice feel of key pressure resistance. Not too soft and not to stiff. [See Cons 3.) below.]4.) 8 angle of tilt for typing. (vs 7 for the Apple model) and the anterior lip is slightly higher making for a slightly more supportive feel when your hands are in position for typing.5.) includes a small instruction booklet that gives easy to follow and accurate directions to connect via bluetooth to both your IPad/IPhone or your Windows based system.6.) has 4 slide-resistant footings on the underside to prevent movement of this unit while typing.7.) has several 'function' keys which can control, among other things, your music through speakers or headphones. i.e. skip forward/back, pause and mute/volume control. There are certain functions that are unique to Apple, Android and Windows systems that are initiated by specific combo keystrokes.The Cons1.) the Off/On button is on the bottom of this device, so you must turn this unit upside down to turn it off or on. Also, the button is small, recessed and somewhat difficult to access... large fingers might struggle here.2.) there is no light for the 'caps lock' key when engaged.3.) there were a few occasions where the 'enter button' did not respond until pressed quite firmly... this was a rare occurrence.Impressions:N.B. I've only had this unit a short time so I can't comment on the long term. Nor can I comment on its use under an Android or Windows environment.But as of this moment AND as a IPad/IPhone user, this is a very functional, portable bluetooth keyboard made available at a very reasonable price.Despite the minor concerns above, if I was buying a bluetooth keyboard for use with my IPad/IPhone I'd have no hesitancy about purchasing this product.As it is... 4 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholsonraynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com@ralannicholson"	0
600	Very Disappointed...	"Just set these up around the pool. Technically all went well, sound is fair for the price.Problem 1), and if you have a solution, please let me know: They seem to connect only to the headphone jack of my receiver (Denon AVR1611), so when i plug them in, my receiver turns off the main speakers. Called Denon, and the operator either didn't know much or just couldn't help.Problem 2) I would like to plug them into my 6 and 7 speaker connectors in my Denon. I already have 2 outdoor speakers connected to those terminals (my main Zone is set as 5.1). I would like to connect/piggyback the Mutant Media Blocks (MMB) to those same speaker terminals, but don't know what kind of wiring adapter i need. Essentially, I would be going from 2 red/black terminals to 2 RCA jacks (that is 4 to 2). In addition, since these are ""amped"" speaker terminals, will it affect (blow up) my MMB wireless transmitter?Thank you all for your help.BTW, if you are looking for buying advice and you don't mind using up your headphone jack for these wireless speakers, go ahead. Fair price for the item.Any enlightenment would be appreciated.Email: LDykler@forefront.caFollow up, Oct 27/2010.Have been in contact with ""support"". They told me to forget connecting the transmitter to the speaker terminals, might damage the transmitter. Again, if anyone did this or knows if it would work, i would appreciate the info.Part of the marketing literature says ""Perfect for some quiet background music for yourself, or playing music for a large party"". Well, forget a party of any kind. Since you can only connect these to the headphone jack of the receiver, all receivers will automatically turn off all speakers as soon as you plug anything to the hp jack."	1
601	Not a Sharp one	I bought this lens for my needs to get wide angle shots as most lenses ristrict you to a very short angle. It does the job but I m not very happy with the sharpness the more you go away from subject the more blurry picture you will get. I tried different locations and differnt options but nothing works.its a good lens if you are only working in outdoors but for indoor although it says its F2.8 but the quality of pictures will not be worth the price.	1
602	nice sub!!	I picked up this sub at best buy on clearance. This little sub blows!!!! I got it  brand new for $99.00 at Best buy their remodeling their magnolia room. I got a great!!!!! Deal, considering that regular price is almost $300.00. Very happy with it!!! Rocks the floor and the windows.	0
603	Cheaply made	I have used my reflector stand probably 3 times since I bought it. I went to an event this past weekend where I was a vendor for my photography and the round piece that holds the arm broke. The knob that is supposed to tighten it to the stand completely broke off. You can see how cheaply it's made. The reflectors themselves are nice, but the stand is garbage. I attempted to return and am already out of my &#34;return window.&#34; So I guess I'm just out of my money! Buy elsewhere!!	1
604	2X USB 2.0	Approx 145mbs throughput. Go flex adapter gives me around 220+. About as fast as my SATA III SSD can go w/out raid etc. Both adapters should give 10X USB 2.0 with a fast enough source. Obviously this Kingwin won't ever reach this limit. (600 mbs) However, it is quite a bit cheaper than the Seagate adapter.	0
605	Great but with a major LCD problem	This netbook is great, the features on it made it an instant buy for me.It's fast, quiet, battery lasts more than I expected, image quality is great.My only issue with this netbook is that the LCD cable failed within two months.I do open and close the LCD at least once a day if not more but still, it's way too early for something like that to fail. When the cable fails you will get a white screen. Mine was doing this while I was opening and closing it, which clearly indicated a bad connection. After reading online about other people having the same issue I decided to take a look myself. I also replaced the HDD with a solid state drive which presumably voids the warranty. I didn't even bother with warranty since I didn't want to waste the time with samsung replacing a cable that is faulty by design.After taking the LCD cable out I realized that the shield wire for the cable actually broke. It looks like the shield wire is used for more than just shielding. The fix was simple and I was able to do it in one evening without stress. You just have to remove the LCD cable and take the isolating tape off of it and you will expose the broken wire. I replaced the shield wire with a more flexible wire to prevent further issues. The problem is that the LCD cable is routed through the hinges in a very ugly manner and there's not a whole lot you can do about it. I'll post back if it fails again.Since I had the screen apart I installed an aftermarket touch screen which makes this netbook an even greater toy.So, while the computer is great and now works awesome, for the average user the LCD cable issue is a show stopper an something that can result in a lot of lost time. I think that's not acceptable from a respectable brand and if you search online you will see a lot of people have had this issue.Hope this post helps people that are having the same problem that I did.Thanks for reading.	1
606	OK, but I own an iPad not a plate...	"For the price you can't complain, but you can get it cheaper through the company that makes them (search ""gibson holders""), but I find that spending a little more and getting an iPad/Netbook specific device is worth the money for the ""extra"" features specific to use for those devices.Like ""Bear Motion (TM) Kickstand Stand Adjustable Handheld Electronics Holder"" or ""Kickstand Stand Adjustable Handheld Electronics Holder for Apple Ipad, Iphone and other laptop computer below 12""(white)""But for those who don't want to invest the extra $10 for their $500 plus device you can get one of these and it will work OK."	0
607	I HIGHLY Recommend This Case	I recently received a Kindle Fire HD 7 as a birthday present. i immediately began to shop on Amazon for a nice case to store it in. I believe I carefully looked at every case that Amazon offered. I came very close to purchasing a very attractive dual-toned genuine leather case that cost twice as much as this rooCASE. But I didn't get it. Although I didn;t completely understand what wasbeing referred to, I opted for the rooCASE because of the auto wake/sleep feature, as well as the included stylus / ink pen.The rooCASE is very well made, and perfectly fits the SECOND GENERATION Kindle Fire HD 7, and provides rugged and secure protection for the Kindle, ! The name itself  rooCASE is kind of a slang way to cleverly convey the idea that the case provide the same protection for the Kindle Fire that the pouch of a kangaroo provides for their young.I read a review that complained that the auto wake/sleep feature did not work. I don't know why that would be true. It WORKS!I have read reviews that said that the stylus was missing, or that the rooCASE had a terrible odor. I smell nothing from my case.I am not saying that the above complaints are not true for those purchasers. Rather, I am saying that you should not assume thatthose claims are universally true for every rooCASE that Amazon sells. They were not true for me, and most others like me!Bottom line: I am 101% satisfied with my purchase. I love the case, the feel, the fit, the features, the stylus, and the quality of the rooCASE. It fits the Kindle like a very protective glove. For all of the above, I enthusiasitcally recommend this case for your Second Generation (2013) Kindle Fire HD 7.mr.arv	1

609	Issues with NIC Card. Otherwise great board.	I bought this board for a new litecoin mining rig (heavy GPU utilization, on 24/7 computer).  On arrival the NIC was not working, confirmed this with Gigabyte support online.  I did an RMA through gigabyte and they sent me a brand new board.  I was pleasently suprised as I usually have to go through the vendor for computer part RMAs.  So +1 to gigabyte for the easy RMA process, unfortunately I cant get more than 4 stars since it had a faulty part at the start.	1
610	works for now	It dos it's job and it comes at a very good price but it's a little quirky the way it attached to the flash	0
611	love	Great pictures, very clear. Phots's of people come out very clear, so easy to use can make anyone a good photographer	0
612	Good Value	While I am not 100% certain it lasts as long as my original. for the money its a good value.  And the company stands behind its products.  If u think you battery is not quite up to snuff, they will happily send you a replacement or give u a refund.  That's good.	0
613	Not worth the money	Yiu get what you pay for. The scroll wheel operates when it wants to, if that. Just do yourself a favor and fork out the extra funds for a mouse that will respond at your command.	1
614	Don't try to format this with a windows vista machine!	It works as advertised if you don't try to get too clever. I wanted to take a short cut in copying off all my files from my old 32g microSD to this one, so I could use it in my samsung galaxy tab 7.7. First thing I did was put it in the galaxy tab and format it - 59gigs was yielded. Great so far. Then I used two separate card readers in an attempt to copy the files from the 32g to the 64g card. The computer prompted me, telling me that the new card needed formatting, and asked if I wanted it formatted to fat32. So, I clicked yes; although I couldnt understand the prompt, since I had JUST formatted the card using my tablet. Thats when the effluent hit the fan, cause the computer froze in the attempt and that microSD hasn't worked on either my laptop or my tablet since.Figured I'd got a dud or did something wrong, so I bought a new one and left the new card on board the tablet. Copied all files using the tablet's proprietary usb connection. So far so good. So guys, my advice would be to not try to use your computer to change the file system to fat 32. But that's just IMHO.	0
615	Belkin, works well for me.	I wanted to wait a little while for submitting feedback on this item. Didn't have anything to do with the Belkin name, because that was one of the main reasons i got it. My main concern i thought a wireless router was a wireless router. So that's where some of the skepticism coming from. I did't want to shell out in a router when i got a cheaper one from my cable provider. After months of weak signal from my wireless router i decided to get this item. It's important to me to get a strong wireless signal, considering that i have two laptops, two smart phones, and a wireless printer. So as soon as i hooked it up i could tell the difference. My phones or laptops haven't dropped low signal. Also the installation was simple, every thing took less than fifteen minutes, that's including taken it out the box. Very good Belkin router with a strong signal output. Very pleased with this product.	0
616	Truly a Monster	"I was initially very skeptical about this unit.The first impression is basically one of the overdone MONSTER units.However, once  you get it, just a simple two button press, and you have voice commands, and these can be switchedoff at any time. The unit is clear and crystal, not robotic by any means, and it tells you by sounds, sound effectsand command responses what is happening. You can even say "" What can I say"" and it gives responses on what you canask[ However, the annoying part of this command is that if not said just right it never happens and it is a pivotalcommand] .When in battery mode ( not plugged in to a  power line ) the unit will last a certain period and then youneed to power up again ( but it will still keep voice command on after a sleep ). So, you can plug  in with a 3.5mmcable to use your ipod, or power from the PC using USB, also you have cables to adapt to a live main.Audio frommultiple souces work well. The ipod is cable straight in, and your blue tooth music works great. The unit pre-supposes you have a phone with Blue tooth and text , voicemail and other capabilities, but it will work withoutthose items.However, other than music, the hands free speakerphone mode is about the only other thing it does.Forthe most part test out what the unit does, and it seems that  you do better with certain smart phones than withother phones."	0
617	Great USB	THE TRANSCEND JET FLASH - 8 GB USB IS EXCELLENT FOR HELP WITH HOME WORK IN HIGH SCHOOL, I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.	0
618	Fantastic value	I've been running this receiver for about a week now after upgrading from my older Yamaha HTR-5790.  One of the biggest reasons I wanted to upgrade was to be able to get HDMI switching and HD audio capabilities.  Switching all of my components to HDMI instead of the mixture of component cables, hdmi direct to TV, and optical cables really helped to clean up some of the cable clutter behind my home theater.  It also made input switching much easier, since now my TV can stay on a single HDMI input and let the receiver do the rest.The on-screen menu is nice and helpful.  The flexibility in assigning input names/sources is very nice, but it can also get complicated.  Not the receivers fault though, for most people it should be a very straight-forward setup, but if you need to re-assign some things for a more advanced setup (like I needed to), then the ability to do so is there.At first the receiver didn't setup the ethernet port properly, I had a cable plugged into it and it showed that there was a link on my network switch, but the options to configure the network settings in the receiver were grayed out.  I updated the firmware via a USB stick from the Onkyo website and then the network features all worked great.  The different music streaming options are great and work well.  It can also stream music from computers on the network with shared music.  It's too bad it can't also stream pictures / videos too.Overall this is a great receiver with fantastic options.  The only thing that I've found that it can't do that my old Yamaha could, is activate Night Mode on DTS sources.  The Onkyo can do it with Dolby Digital sources, but not DTS.  This isn't a huge deal, but it's odd that it has this limitation.	0
619	Doesn't do much....but what it does do is done well	"I'm a bit baffled by some of the negative reviews for this item that complain it doesn't have volume control. That's like buying a Honda Civic and then posting a negative review because it lacks a sports suspension. Maybe that would be a good thing, but the description doesn't say it has volume control. I do think, however, that the description posted on Amazon is a bit ambiguous because it just says that this item gives you ""track control"".  What does THAT mean? If you want to be able to search within a song, you will be disappointed with this. But if you need a simple device that allows you to start/stop sound tracks and skip forward/backward, then this is what you're looking for.  The device itself is pretty simple: it's shaped kinda like a flattened peanut shell, with the center button controlling stop/start and each of the ends in charge of forward and back (I used to have a similar device that only had one button which you had to press a different number of  times to make it do different things....and if you didn't time the presses just right, it did something other than what you intended. So I really appreciate that the Griffin model has dedicated buttons). It produces a loud click when you press the buttons, which I think contributes to the somewhat cheap look and feel. But the bottom line is that it works, easily. I haven't used it much yet, so don't know how it will hold up over time. But for now, I'm a happy camper. Oh, and the service from SFPlanet was great...it arrived in about 3 days after I placed my order."	1
620	Ok but still a not overly impressed.	I just received this netbook a few days ago.. I had the same model with XP that was about 2 years old and quit working. I liked my old ASUS and used it a great deal.. Thought it quit a little before it's time though.. I can't say i'm real impressed with Windows 7 Starter.. It seems real choppy and unsmooth.. Maybe if I bump up the ram it might help.. The e-mail program is something to be desired.. I guess i'm an old diehard Outlook Express user for e-mail and sending photos.. I do have one desktop that is running Windows 7 home and that seems a little better.. For a netbook, I think XP was a better choice. With this one, Start up time is horrible.  Also took a few hours to remove all the free preloaded garbage they install.. In my opinion, i'm not seeing a real advantage to owning this over a regular laptop.  Maybe if you travel quite a bit it would be nice because it's light weight.. The screen is pretty small but it's a netbook..  I do have to give Amazon a big thumbs up, as it arrived way before expected.  Bottom line: maybe ok for everyday e-mailing and surfing, but you can get a laptop for just a little more money and I think most would be happier with a bigger screen, bigger keyboard, and also a faster, smoother operating system.. I would stay with XP, but we have to keep up with the changing times. Soon it will not be supported and Windows 7 will be the main choice.  Unless you're netbook has XP, I would probably keep looking for something other than Windows 7 Starter on a netbook..	1

622	Griffin Elan Form Hard-shell Leather Case for iPod nano 3G (Black)	Purchased this to protect my son's iPod. This is a wonderful product! Great price, works perfectly to keep the iPod safe and secure. Would definitely recommend this one!	0
623	Great Kindle Fire Case	Loved the case.  Attractive, very sturdy & protective.  Folds open nicely so it can be viewed in the horizontal position.  In addition the elastic strap is very nice.  I use it all the time to help prevent my fumble fingers from accidental slippage onto the floor.	0
624	Nice	I was pleased with this item and was impressed with how quickly I received it.  At no fault to the seller, I was just not thrilled with the all black color like I imagined I would like.  So instead I sold it to a friend, but it worked great and fit my iPad 3 as intended.	0

627	My friends say she loves it	I got this for a friend whose laptop keyboard stopped working. Since this is a USB keyboard, it was perfect for her. Obviously it was a little awkward to use, but i'm not sure this product was meant to be used in that way. She said that she liked it, and it allowed her to use her laptop with ease. This is a good product- i mean, it's a keyboard, with one purpose. It was a good price as well.	0
628	They work with my 3D tv!	Not only do they work with my tv, they're actually the same kind that came with it. The tv I got was at a good price, but only came with 2 glasses, which wasn't enough for my family, so I ordered these to go along with it, and they work perfectly.	0
629	Great quality!	After keeping my old key shell in my pocket for a year because I didn't realize how inexpensive it was to replace the damaged shell I found this and was very happy and also surprised how easy it was to replace. Great item and works like original.	0
630	These didn't work. And they're super cheap. SO cheap that they're not worth the $2 you probably are thinking about spending...	These did not work. And when they come from Hong Kong and only cost $2, it's just NOT worth it to try and return for that money back. SO save yourself the trouble and drop a few more bucks on one that works.	1
631	Great	Use this item often when doing time exposures. As an amateur astronomer this product comes in very handy when doing astro photography.	0
632	Silver is gold!	it works and have enough for @ least 10 more builds !!! yay (may be even more )  a must have	0
633	Amazing sound, but...	These headphones sound better than most I have bought for over $50, but they are made of poor quality materials and they hurt the inside of my ears (due to the construction of the piece that intrudes the ear).  It is not a typical circular sphere that enters your ears when you put these on, but more like an oval shape that stands tall and presses against your ear.  Maybe I have small ears canals or something, but these hurt after 15 minutes and I'd rather not wear these if I have the choice.  Awesome sound, very uncomfortable.	1
634	Bad cable	This thing is garbage. I admit that it could have been my system but a relatively new Sony Viao all in one and a Toshiba external HD shouldn't be hard to connect but it didn't. My drivers are all updated as my esata and usb ports work fine in all aspects. I just think this cable is either poorly made or maybe just the one I had was. Either way, I'm not about to find out again.	1
635	Cheap but works!	Needed to connect Turtle Beach headphones to the 360 with HDMI to the TV.  Perfect solution and an excellent price.	0
636	Good little charger.	This did exactly what it was supposed to do. I went a little crazy with RC helicopters recently and this thing allowed me to charge two at a time. Not to mention it will come in handy if we have company.	0
637	HD is not recognized by XP, Vista or Win 7 computers	I kind of like the fact that it has a built-in fan, but the enclosure just doesn't work.  I tried two different PATA HD's, but the HD's are not recognized by none of my computers (XP, Vista and Windows 7).  By the way, the HD's are perfectly functional, i.e., it's not the HD's problem.So, I returned the Sabrent enclosure.  I instead bought a StarTech External HD Enclosure, which works fine.  The particular Sabrent unit that I got might happen to be a defect, but I just don't have time to give them another chance.	0
638	Fantastic case	Pros:full protection allowing access to ports***the stand***  I LOVE IT!!!the feet on the bottom provide fantastic airflow for the Mac to cool down and keep a reasonable temperature (as the design for air intake was poorly done on the Mac).Cons:my only regret was that i didn't get this sooner	0
639	Excellent VIZIO Remote	This remote is better than the original bring with the TV.  It has new functions that works with the tv.  Very good remote.	0
640	Awesome	Geat product, lowest price I've found, it the real deal, this otter is the full defender series at an incredible price. This otter box for the inspire/desire is better quality then the otter for iPhone. Very pleased with the product and shipping was reasonable.	0
641	Very nice headphones	My wife gave me these for my b-day last week as she knows I love my iPod Nano.  I've been using a mid-grade pair of in the ear type earbuds.  I liked those as the sound is good and the foam plugs block out a lot noise.  Since I use them when outside doing yard work (mowing, trimming) that is a plus.  Since it's winter here now I don't know how well the iMuffs will work when I'm mowing and such.  But even if I switch back to the foam earphones when mowing, there are many reasons I like the iMuffs for the other times.-Being cordless is great.  I've had the foam plugs pulled from my ears too many times and that isn't pleasant.  I even run the cord inside my shirt, but it still would seem to get caught on things.-Works great to control the iPod.  No more digging in my pocket to skip, pause, adj volume, etc.-Works well with my Razr.  Although like someone else said, I have to tell my phone to search for the iMuffs, it isn't automatic.  But that will be a very nice feature this summer when I'm out in the yard and my wife calls me.  I always have my iPod playing and don't always feel the phone vibrate.-Comfortable and lightweight.  As others have said, it isn't adjustable but should work for most people I would think.  It feels like it will stay put even for physical activities.-Sound is very good.  I don't have any buzzing or interference type noises.  I would say the sound is inline with my $100 earbuds.Negatives:-Price.  Not cheap, but these are more than just earphones.-Bluetooth adapter will drain the battery faster.  I'm also not sure how long the headphones will last on one charge.Overall, these are very nice.  I would like to give it 4.5 stars.  I'm not giving it 5 because of the price and I don't think it will block external noise as well as my foam earbuds.	0
642	Decent Headset	I have been using this headset for about a week now. I use with with my phone for calls and at the same time with my laptop for audio at work. Here is my initial impression.Pros:1. Decent sound quality: Bass is a little low. But expected in this price range and type. But very clear. Adequate volume.2. Simultaneous connectivity to a phone device and a music device. This is nice. Works out beautifully for me.3. Device memory. Remembers paired devices - no pairing every time you switch.4. Decent range - works in my entire two bedroom apartment.5. Battery life is as promised - lasts around 6 hours of audio time (phone/music)Cons:1. NOT the most comfortable headset I have used. A design where the weight is not on your ears might be more comfortable to wear for longer periods. Having said that - you do get used to it after a while and it does not bother as much.2. Side controls are a little hard to guess and activate. Usable but barely.3. The rocker material is not very solid - tends to lose shape very easily.Conclusion:Its a decent stereo headset with the convenience of wireless. Good sound with slight ergo/usability inconvenience for cheap.	1
643	Just buy it	Why spend  up to $40 for a cover that this does just as well.  Great quality, feel and fit.  Highly recommend it.	0
644	It IS what it's SUPPOSED to be!	'Called PREMIUM GRADE ELECTRICAL TAPE: 2 in.Hey! 'Know what? That's EXACTLY what it is! (Wonders never  cease) The product is well worth the $$$. Of course it's just a bit wide for normal electrical work, but I use it for 'light shields' around windows for a church media center. This wide, black tape is perfect for keeping out unwanted ambient light from the outside, is of a high grade and is well worth the money......but, alas, I already SAID that.'Needing some good, wide electrical tape? BUY IT!	0
645	Good, inexpensive speakers	Needed more sound to my laptop to hear the TED talks.  This little speaker system makes it all work for me.  Good value for the money.	0
646	Streams Audio Like a Champ	PRO:+ Easy installation+ Audio sounds greatCON:- No color changing optionI installed this pretty quickly. I installed my receiver with Posi products for the wires. To install this, I unscrewed the cap, inserted the bluetooth wires and then screwed the cap back on. Real easy.Haven't used the phone function yet as I bought it to stream audio. In that regards, music sounds fantastic. I can't comment on call quality and I'm not expecting much as I installed the unit in a tucked-away place.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. Not a fan of the colors, though. Blue and green is an odd mix that doesn't match anything in my car.	0
647	Good Unit	"I replaced my Garmin Nuvi 650 that I had for over 2 years with Magellan 1440 last week and I'm happy with the performance so far.My Garmin served me well for over 2 years until it the touch screen stopped responding. I went to Costco to buy a replacement and saw this unit for $79.00 so decided to give it a try.First thing that I noticed are the differences between the Nuvi 650 and this new unit. Please remember that I'm comparing a new Magellan unit to a 2 1/2 year old Nuvi so there might be some improvement on the new Garmin units.1. Speaker: Garmin speaker is a lot better than this unit. I hear static on this unit when I adjust the volume to its highest. It's still understandable when you have the radio on but not as clear as my Garmin unit.2. LCD: I mount the units in the vent using a third party vent mount. My Garmin is a lot clearer even when the sun hits the screen. Magellan LCD are clear on non sunny day and is hard to see once the sun is on it's highest. Anyway, the instruction is clear enough that I don't need to look at the screen.3. Voice: I like the Garmin voice better as it is more human like. After a week of use, I'm now getting used to the Magellan voice and instruction so it not a big deal for me anymore. Garmin will say something like ""On right"" while Magellan says ""Keep to the right""4. Direction: I like the way Magellan gives the direction ahead of time and tells me which side will be my next turn.  I also like the way Magellan gives you another reminder when you are approaching a turn or an exit and the bell it sounds when it is time to turn.  Garmin tells you the next move at around 1 mile and around .2 miles but I will have to listen to the street name given or check the GPS constantly to see if I'm on the right corner as it does not give you anymore signal when it is time to turn. Of course this is an older product.5. Re-Route: When you missed a turn Garmin will say ""Re-calculating"" while it calculate your next turn. This unit does not do that, it will simply recalculate and change its course. At first, I was confused as I was waiting for the GPS to acknowledge a missed turn but I'm used to it now. I feel that it is actually better as my passenger will not know that I missed a turn if they are not paying attention to the road. With Garmin once they hear the word re-calculating they know already that I missed a turn.6. Navigation: It seem to give me the same instruction as my Garmin. It now have the 125 freeway as I have the latest map so that is a plus. Also, Magellan shows you 4 route option (fastest, shortest, most use of freeways, least use of freeways). Garmin also have these but it only shows you the option you select in the settings menu.7. Junction View: I don't have this on my Garmin. I have not really looked at the junction view as the direction is already clear and tells me in advance which lane to stay. I guess when I go into an unfamiliar place, I may look into this screen.8. Address Input: Magellan input screen is a little slow to register. At first I always ended up selecting a different street as I type faster than the unit. You will hear the unit say the letter but it still does not register on the screen so you end up typing the next letter which the unit will recognize and give you a totally different address selection. And when the selection appears, it appears fast that when you are trying to type the whole street or city, you end up selecting from the selection so you have to hit the back button to redo your selection. I believe this is a bug because the voice confirms the letter you type while the text on the screen does not. Example is when you intend to type FOURTH the unit will say the word F.O.U.R while it does not register let say ""U"" so you end up with FOR on the screen and it will show street starting with FOR... i.e. (FORTY, etc..) and since the screen shows the selection too fast, and you are still typing the rest of the letter, you will end up selecting a different street. I have to slow down a little in entering addresses to make sure I get to the right address.9. Destination Reached: Magellan tells you that you have arrived then reads and displays the address that you have which I like. My old unit does not do this and I sometimes have to check my note or go back to previous screen to check the house number.10. Satellite signal: Satellite reception if fast. First boot took me around 20 seconds to acquire signal. It is usually the same when I have to turn off the unit and turn it on again on a different location. If you turn on the machine on the same location you turned it off, you usually get signal in a couple of seconds. My Garmin takes at least 3 minutes or at least a minute if turned on the same location.11. POI search: Fast when you use the category option as it first narrows down the select to location near you (around 5 mile radius). It then gives you option to expand the search if you want a longer radius. When you use the spell name, it takes at least a minute or 2 depending on what you are searching.12. Display arrangement: I like the garmin screen better, you can easily see your direction, speed, and ETA. You will have to toggle through the display selection on the lower left from Magellan if you want to see these option. Maybe I got use to seeing all those option from the last 2 1/2 years that I am using garmin that is why I continue to look at those data. If you only use Magellan or if this is your first GPS, you will not notice the difference.One thing I noticed is that when I first enter an address outside the city where I first used it, it does not show me the range of number that I want. It shows 3250-8000 when I need a 3007 number. When I use the POI (the address is for a business) it shows the 3007 address. After I select the POI and create the route to that address, I tried entering the address again manually and it was there and available. The range increase from 3250-8000 to 1-8000. When I looked over online I saw on one page (I don't have the link anymore) where it says that when you enter a new location and could not find the address, you can first create a route on that city by selecting the city center from POI then all the address range will be available. It looks to me that it is a bug and this is a workaround. So, far I was not able to replicate that problem. Also, I have upgraded my firmware and map after I experience that problem so the update may have fixed it.I will continue to put this unit to test and if it works as expected, I will add the traffic link cord to also get the traffic reports.Conclusion:  I cannot attest to the durability of the unit as of this time as I only have it for the week but for the price, I recommend this product. The directions are clear and it will take you to the address you tell it to go. The screen may be hard to see but the spoken direction is clear enough for me that I don't look at the screen anyway. Another thing is that I have put a protective screen on my Garmin. This may have also reduce the glare from the sun. I will try installing a protective screen on this unit and see if that will make the screen more viewable."	0
648	Lightweight, very large in diameter	This is for a rather heavy camera such as an EOS 5D with a substantial lens.  It is very stable.  It is at least 2 inches in diameter in its largest section.	0
649	Too many problems ...	I owned this device for well over a year before I could use it due to compatibility issues. I had purchased several cables trying to get this to connect to my Mac for sometime and even invested in the alternate docking bay which was supposed to make it compatible with other versions of the OS. Nope. Wouldn't connect. Nothing but problems.Later when I hooked it up to a new machine &#8230; nothing. The thing was a ghost from jump and I never realized it. Now it's a huge black paperweight that performed poorly OOTB.	1
650	Very nice GPU	The only reason it got 4 was because I reserved my 5 star rating for the GTX 680 Lightning I got to replace it.	0
651	One of my better gadget purchases~~	Very happy with this item.First I can confirm it does not block the charging contacts on the Original Surface RT!Pretty nice how it's made to fit the edge of the Surface.This thing makes life much, much easier by adding extra ports\card slots.So glad I finally decided to buy this...	0
652	Works just fine	I use this to connect the audio from my Dell Dimension 2400 to an LCD TV.  The sound is decent.	0
653	Very cool and trendy case	My wife loved this case for her 15 inch MBP. Excellent quality materials and craftsmanship make this a no-brainer for anyone looking for a unique case for a 15-inch laptop.	0
654	Much better than other AT&T phone	I wanted a phone that could be wall hung, had an easy answering feature and expandability. This phone has met all my expectations. The setup was a little tricky but it works well. My former AT&T phone was so annoying I almost didn't buy this one. But the features are definitely more user friendly in this model.and I'm very happy with it. I've had none of the issues others down-rated the phone for. I've already added accessory handsets in other areas of the house. The problem with the former phone  was that the small tab that allows the receiver to stay on when used as a wall phone broke. The phone was still under warranty but the part was always unavailable---MONTH AFTER MONTH. Probably cost them less than a quarter. The only option offered other than to use it as a desk model was to mail the phone to them at my expense (about $12) and they would replace it! I didn't want a desk model -- I needed something that could be hung on the wall. Sounded as if that was a design flaw if they couldn't keep the part in stock.	0
655	Great little keyboard for PS3	I bought this for use with my PS3 because I got tired to having to unplug my racing wheel to plug in the wired keyboard (I only have one USB extension cord - all other devices must be plugged in at the entertainment center).  I strongly considered buying the official Playstation keyboard but for $20 extra, it didn't seem to have any special features that this keyboard was missing.  The quick media keys on the PS3 keyboard are just duplicates of the left and right arrow and Enter key respectively and provide no extra function.  It's nice to have the Playstation equivalent buttons labeled (Triangle->F1, Square->F2, X->Enter, Circle->Escape) but I already have them memorized from years of use.Playstation 3 Usability Requirements (in my opinion):-  Dedicated Arrow keys - needed to navigate the Playstation menu system-  Dedicated Function keys - F1 and F2 are needed to emulate Triangle and Square button presses-  Dedicated Escape key - needed to emulated the Circle button-  Touchpad - because I almost never need a mouse anyway-  USB wireless or bluetooth-  Easy to use without looking / in the darkPros:-  Small keyboard size but with traditional key layout (mostly*)-  Dedicated function keys-  Wireless-  Takes standard batteries-  Touchpad with right and left click buttons-  Extra left-click button (top left)-  Left-click functions as X button, right-click as Triangle buttonCons for me:-  *Right Shift too small (the Up key is where the right shift key should begin)-  Arrow keys not separated from keyboardMaybe cons for you:-  Touchpad isn't good at recognizing clicks (although touchpad buttons are great)-  No dedicated Page Up, Paqe Down, Home, End, or Print Screen keys-  Tilt angle not adjustableSummary:My main gripe is the too-small Right Shift key.  I shift primarily with my right hand only on this keyboard that means hitting the up key which jumps the Playstation input dialog to the beginning of the line.  Very annoying!  Now this is a big deal to me as I'm an experienced typist.  If you hunt-and-peck, you won't even notice.  The fact that the arrow keys are not separated from the other keys makes them harder to find when you're not looking directly at the keyboard but thankfully they put them in the lower right-hand corner so they're easy to locate once you get the feel and remember where they are.  This keyboard definitely takes a little adjustment to get used to but since I won't it much, I think I'm ok with that.  The extra strange and otherwise useless left click button in the upper left hand corner works like a Play/Pause key which is fantastic.  The way the left click works as the X button and right click as the Triangle button is fantastic and came as a complete surprise to me.  That gives me two easy-to-access keys to Play/Pause media as well as an easy way to access the media menu (right click).  I specifically did not want a rechargeable keyboard because I didn't want to muck about with having to recharge it.  Apart from my small gripes I quite like this.  It's very functional and if I could just remember not to try to use the Right Shift key, I just might stop cursing at it.	0
656	Good purchase	I just needed a spare battery. This one seems to work well and hold a good charge in comparison to the one that came with my camera.	0
657	I wish there were 6 stars avail....	I don't even know where to begin. This speaker is EPIC. Put it in a box designed for it and hit it with 800W RMS and you won't believe what happens. I was gonna order a second one and put them both in my rig, but I fear that it might rip the fabric of space and time, destroying life as we know it...... so I didn't. You're welcome.	0
658	Found It's Nook	"Pros:1). Excellent color screen2). Firmware Update to Android Froyo 2.1 allows for minor expansion of capabilities3). Responsive touch screen during reading4). Good, sturdy construction5). Exapandable memory with MicroSD card slot6). Weight is slightly heavy, but not too bad at all.Cons:1).  Although it can play videos on the internet, videos are otherwise extremely hard to find that fit the format for the player.  For example, Amazon.com Instant Video plays .wmv files, which is not a compatible format.  Converting these files to another format is next to impossible, since Amazon.com instant video doesn't support the Nook Color.  Amazon.com, CinemaNow (through Best Buy), and even Itunes movies are all DRM protected and won't run on the Nook Color due to lack of support (trust me, I've tried them all).2).  Not connected to Android app store...Barnes and Noble currently (as of 5/11/11) only has 148 apps in their ""Nook Apps Store"".Overall: B+The Color Nook is a great e-reader with inernet capabilities and limited android Apps.  Although a Android Firmware update was released in May 2011, the limitations of the device can be seen through lack of impressive apps and extreme lack of ""Other-than-internet"" video playback, put the Color Nook down a coulpe of notches in my book.  Overall though, this is an impressive e-reader for the novice user who is looking for a light travel device that can offer internet connectivity and decent battery life."	1
659	Buy these items and enjoy good quality.	Once an item lives up to the seller's performance description, then it achieves three things once delivery was as stated: 1. value for money 2. quality customer service and 3. truth in advertising. This seller's good has said all this of their business.I bought both items fully appraised, through the clear description on the Seller's Amazon page, of how each would perform and their individual advantages for we who wear spectacles. Both have been tried out and while I am using the  Eyepiece / Eyecup (Canon EF Replacement) for CANON Rebel as my primary attachment, I am happy to have the Eyepiece / Eyecup (Ef and Eb Compatable) for CANON REBEL as my back-up when conditions and situations demand its use.Buy these items and enjoy good quality.	0
660	Great auto off - annoying stand	The great: The Nexus 7 Google tab fits perfectly into this. It also looks great in the black and red contrast and the rubber band that pulls around to secure it all is a good addition. Plus the felt/suede feel of the inside red lining is really good quality and seems to be gentle on the tab itself.The good: It does switch off and on the screen when you open and close but once every eon it will switch off when you flick it the other way around. This is a rare occurrence and so does not bother me in the least.The blah: I never ever use the stand because 1. the nexus seems to prefer vertical viewing which isn't so handy in this horizontally adjustable viewing system, and 2. the indents which are supposed to hold the thing up when horizontal are a great idea but do not work quite so well - it keeps sliding down. It actually looks great when you finally figure out the positioning - just don't jolt too hard or it all collapses; That said, I would buy again since I have it in the case for protection not for viewing. Four stars!UPDATE: If you do want something for viewing handsfree: I bought an external folding stand instead from Arkon which is great and works with or without a case for any tab. Also, its now over a year later and the edges are wearing off (little rubber strips peeling off) at the corners. Still a great buy for the price.	1
661	Doesn't work, tuner is poor tried in two different cars	Let me add to the chorus of reviewers that say that this product does NOT work.  Tried it in both cars with the same problem:  Tuner is POOR.  It barely produces a clear enough signal to be audible (and that was trying with the many channels (both manual and automatic) designated as clear frequencies).  I am somewhat at a loss to explain why Microsoft would allow such a poor quality product to go out of the door with its' name on it.  To make matters worse, when you try to return the item using the Amazon return merchandise screen the option to select return reason is grayed out so that it is not possible to go forward with the return request.  So buyer beware,,, this item should NOT be purchased it clearly is poor workmanship and even free would be charging too much.	1
662	A little pricey but good	"I found them for under $150. I do agree the bass is a little lacking, but maybe I should reserve complete judgment until they are 'broken in' (if that even makes a difference?) If more bass materializes then its easily 5 stars.I will say that I notice right away better CLARITY over ear buds in the $75 - $100 range, recently owning Creative Zen buds (very good for the price BTW) and entry level Shure SE 110. Also have heard Bose earbuds in the $100 range. These 310's do have less deep thumping BASS then those....but I'm digging the extra clarity.I can now even tell imperfections in some compressed MP3 songs (maybe thats not good? ha!) Guitars and drums and vocals are clear, distinct, and detailed. But its missing that fun thumping bass, making me think I'd be disappointed if I paid full retail price.I think they're well made and are more comfortable than the earlier Shure bud design. Im very used to how to properly insert into ear, and selecting the correct size insert, so the lack of bass is not operator error....... Sound isolation, in my opinion, is MUCH better than electronic 'noise canceling"".overall, a solid 4 stars if you can get them at a discount.UPDATE!!!After about a YEAR and a HALF, one earbud stopped working. I always keep these dry in its case, so I dont know how this happened.I'm not going to buy high end pricey earbuds anymoreI bought the JVC HAFX67B Air Cushion earbuds for 20 bucks and they are REALLY GOOD, I definitely do not miss the expensive Shures, and its nice piece of mind that theyre inexpensive to replace"	0
663	legit	To be honest i was not expecting a whole lot from this little thing but iv got it hooked up to 13 different speakers ranging from 1&#34; tweets to a 12&#34; sub and this little amp pushes each of them extremely clean, this little amp is defiantly worth 3 times the price.	0
664	Really enjoying it	24' Really is all you need in a monitor, personally I think with a 27' you're looking around too much for gaming.  Anyways, this monitor came with no dead pixels, the 1080p videos look amazing on  it and blu-ray 3d just blows me away.  I've tried a few games in 3d and have had no issues with the monitor, just be sure your system can take the toll 3d has on it.  Overall I love this product and am very satisfied with the colors, and the smoother picture 120hz offers.	0
665	DiMeCard-SD: SD + MicroSD Memory Card Holder	As its name implies, having so many Micro(SD) cards can be very clunky! This product works as described: it can hold up to 6 microSD cards or 2 SD cards with the MicroSDHC adapter. It's a convenient way of carrying it in a backpack instead of having multiple cards all over the place. It's a great product! Thank you!	0
666	Great Deal and Beautiful Picture	I purchased this TV on Black Monday and it arrived just 2 days later - Amazon has amazing service.  The packaging was done well - no damage in shipping - it had some nice soft foam blocks around all corners of the screen.  Assemble instructions were clear and simple - all you had to do was attach the stand.  All parts were supplied.I researched many other brands and settled on this one.  I had never heard of the manufacturer, but the ratings and comments were good so I took a chance.  The Amazon price was the right combination with the picture size and features for me.  It's not my primary TV, so I didn't want to spend too much.  The set does NOT come with an HDMI cable, so plan to get one if you don't have a spare - it makes a tremendous difference.  With only the usual amount of set-up (with easy to follow manual), the picture is great.You will not be disappointed with this TV.	0
667	Innovative	"I'm not typically the kind of guy that needs help getting something level, so at first I thought that feature - the one that sets this mount apart from the rest - was a little gimmicky.  On the other hand, mistakes do happen and can happen because of the wall material and not completely because of the user, and I am also the kind of guy who will be bothered every moment for the rest of my days if something is not 100% level - even if I can't notice without a level.This mount is nice because it basically levels by gravity and it can be readjusted easily anytime after initial installation.  The included hardware is of good quality, and they give you the correct fasteners for mounting at different depths and on different surfaces (i.e. - anchors for masonry mounting and screws for stud mounting).  You can make the depth just ~1.75"" (which I believe is one of the tightest mounts available) or ~2.5"".  Mounting at 1.75"" is flat, but if you mount it at 2.5"", you can keep it flat or tilt it downward about 30 or so.  That can also be changed after the inital mounting period.Installation is about as simple as you will get as long as you can find your studs.  Note that if you need your panel mounted very precisely from left to right, this will actually be a little more difficult to use than a regular mount (although it can be done precisely with patience and math).  But if you have an inch or two of leighway, it's very straightforward and simple.At time of writing, I don't know what the retail price will be.  If it is in the same ballpark as standard mounts, I'd probably recommend it to just about anyone looking for a mount.  If you have to pay a premium for the leveling feature, it depends on your personal confidence level."	0
668	works better second time around	"The item is fine and quality outstanding however shape is not ""modernized"" with the trends in aluminum-formed chain stays. So the first one I bought disappeared but the second time around I was able to secure it better and keep it going better. I'm happy."	0
669	Better than my other Roku	This is the second Roku device in use here. This model is a step up in model number but less costly than the one I bought at Costco last year. Both do the same thing so not much to say regarding how it handles streaming. This model has WiFi, so no network cable is needed to use it on any number of HD TVs in the house.Had to drop one star however due to the operating temperature. Although it is not smoking, it is very warm to the touch and since Roku's do not have an off switch no way to save all that energy that is being wasted generating heat when the unit is not being used 20 hours or more out of the day. Roku could gain a star by reducing power consumption when in standby mode.	0
670	It's Not That Great	I have lost my patience with this keyboard and mouse.  It works okay for basic mouse and typing functions.  But when I am cruising at 60 to 70 words a minute, when I need to make quick clicking actions with the mouse, this system can't keep up.  I feel like I am learning how to type all over again, I feel like someone is shadowing my computer when using the mouse.  Simply put: this system does not have the response accuracy I need to get my writing projects completed.  It misinterprets keys strokes too often to be of any value.  If you're typing illiterate, you might find it useful for the price.	1
671	Basic power strip	Powers my devices with no problems, just a basic power strip in my eyes, nothing fancy and will protect your gadgets to a extent like any other strip. Worth a buy for basic needs	0
672	Excellent phone.	I bought this earphone after much research and a few tries of other brands. This is the best, with superb clarity, and balance. This phone is sturdy, of good quality. Unless you are super-base fan, this is the right thing for you. For more base, turn on iPod's Equalizer does a wonderful job, better than those much hyped basy phones out there.	0
673	NA	Never used I returned the camera I bought the plan for before I even got the plan activated.Guess they were quick to respond to the canceling of the plan so Good to go.	0
674	Beautiful Television but...	"..I have had to send back two of them to the store simply because the promise of multiple HDMI connections was falling flat. In other words if you have at least 3 HDMI inputs- Sony AV/System/Sony PS3 and any other HDMI Sony product to switch to you may or may not experience the SIGNAL not being picked up as you move around the TVs inputs.If all you want is Cable plus a DVD player via HDMI or Bravia Sync you may never experience my challenges. In short the HDMI inputs on at least 2 purchases have not worked beyond 7 days of usage. STILL This television is Beautiful when alls well. So far I am good with one of my replacements and awaiting the other sometime this week. Yes I love this 46""5100 so much I bought 2 of em..in spite of the HDMI input challenges."	1
675	Dead on arrival, lousy support	"I was looking for a cheaper alternative to replace my aging MacBook Pro.  Fully understanding that I wouldn't be getting as high a build quality as an MBP (and hoping to save a bundle of money in the process), I pulled the trigger and ordered one of these.  It arrived dead, complaining there was no bootable device.  This probably happens a lot, because the packaging LeNovo uses is absolutely pathetic.  The laptop was shipped in a very flimsy box with the computer wedged in between a couple small pieces of styrofoam on either side of the notbook.  That's it. I'm pretty surprised that the computer didn't arrive with a few dents the way it was packaged.  Anyways, I called Lenovo support, and spoke with a gentleman who took my details, provided me a case number, and then attempted to transfer me over to another department for an exchange.  I was then bombarded by advertisements for a free $25 supermarket card and a free gas gift card by an automated system, then disconnected.  Confused by what had just happened, I called back the number I was given in case of disconnect and got the same advertisements.  It appears the LeNovo rep not only gave me the wrong number to call, but also transferred me over to the wrong number.  I called back the main support number, and spoke with a different guy.  He gave me a different number, and then transferred me.  While trying to enter in my number to the irritating automated system I was disconnected again.  I tried calling back the new number I was given, and it just rang forever with no answer.  So for the third time I called the main support number and actually ended up talking with the same person again.  He apologized and tried to transfer me in directly to the correct department, but was unable to do so.  Instead I was given yet another number to try.  By this point I had received a dead computer and wasted an hour just trying to talk to the right person.  Maybe the dead computer was a fluke, but there is just no excuse for the joke that LeNovo calls customer service.  Anyways, after an hour of a half of my life being hung up on on and waiting on hold, I had completely lost faith in Lenovo.  If this is the level of support offered to someone who was shipped a brand new dead computer, what is a regular warranty service call like?  When I finally spoke to someone who could help me, I said if you cannot ship me a replacement overnight then I would like to return the computer.  She said they do not ship replacements overnight.  I got an RMA number, sent the dead laptop back, and will be taking my business elsewhere. Hopefully they Lenovo won't botch the return like they have everything else.Update #1 7/1/12: Yep, they botched it, why am I not surprised? I ordered a bluetooth mouse with the computer, and it was set to ship a week or two after the laptop shipped.  When I told customer service that I wanted a refund on the defective laptop, the rep assured me that the mouse order would be canceled.  Well, I just received shipping confirmation on the canceled mouse order, and my credit card has been charged.  I'm still waiting for my refund on the laptop as well.Update #2 7/9/12: For those who are wondering, the computer was purchased through LeNovo's website, not Amazon. I really, truly wish I had bought this through Amazon, because I would have had my refund and been done with this weeks ago. If you must buy a Lenovo, go through Amazon or a retailer who has a reasonable returns process. I am just posting this review on Amazon for the benefit of others.  As of today I still have not received my refund from LeNovo for either the laptop or the mouse.  Last week I filed a complaint with the BBB. I received an email from the ""Customer Advocate and Complaint Resolutions"" department about 3 days later, but when I try calling the guy who emailed me he is never there.  Going though Lenvo ""support"" is a hopeless endeavor.  I sure hope Lenovo is enjoying the interest free loan they took out on my credit card.  What a racket!Final Update: Things got much better once the BBB was involved.  I finally got my money back after a month of waiting."	1
676	Nice after brief wear-in period	I've purchased multiple Logitech trackballs over the years. This one initially gave me some concerns since the rolling action of the ball felt rough. It took a little while to wear in, and now it is just as marble-like smooth as previous versions. Initially, I didn't like the idea of the unifying USB receiver, but especially after also adding a Logitech wireless keyboard I have come around to it and find it a good solution for multiple Logitech peripherals. Certainly helps to keep BT problems with multiple devices at bay.	0

678	UPDATE: Hate this stick! Formatted with exFAT	"I initially wrote a 5-star review on this stick but after using it a few months I wish I'd never bought it.First, it has no LED activity light which is annoying but not enough to deduct a star. What has me ready to throw it in the trash is the BUGGY and SLOW performance.I normally reformat USB drives from FAT32 to NTFS. When I started having performance problems with this stick (almost immediately) I reformatted it too, thinking it was FAT32. (I was not familiar with exFAT, it wasn't listed in the specs as being exFAT, and I never heard of exFAT until I began having problems and came here to change my review and saw another Amazon reviewer mention his woes, also related to it being exFAT.)exFAT (EXtended FAT) is a MS proprietary format designed to overcome the limitations of FAT32. Like if you are working with gabillions of files or files in excess of 4GB each, exFAT is supposed to be better and more efficient. (exFAT is not designed for hard drives, only for memory sticks.) It was released with VISTA SP1 so only newer MS operating systems recognize it. (e.g. XP and older need a MS patch to be able to handle the drive.) Linux is just starting to become compatible as of the date of this review, as is MAC but those are iffy so if you plan to use your USB stick with MAC or Linux, I'd choose another one (i.e. with FAT32 formatting).I am using W764 (though I also use Linux and would not have chosen this stick had I known all this ahead of time) but when I reformatted the PNY to NTFS then ran chkdsk to make sure the stick was ok, it saw the format as RAW. &lt;!>So I used EASEUS partition manager (freeware tool) to check out the drive and saw there was a hidden partition at the beginning of it. Suspecting there was formatting instructions or other unwanted stuff there, I wiped the hidden partition then merged it with the main one. Then I completely deleted the single partition, re-created it, and reformatted it as NTFS. I then ran a surface scan and all came back ok.Chkdsk now reported no problems and My Computer recognized the stick and all should have been fine, but it wasn't. Trying to write to it was nearly impossible and it was obviously screwed up somehow even though all tests showed it as healthy and good to go.That's when I came here to change my review and saw (from another reviewer) that this stick was formatted as exFAT.I then surmised it might be that I changed it to NTFS (since MS has not released the source on their exFAT formatting, you might not be able to just reformat it to NTFS without problems, or without having to jump through some unknown hoop... at least in my case it appears to be so)... so I opened Admin Tools and right-clicked on the PNY drive and reformatted it once again from NTFS to exFAT (which is a choice in W7).This eliminated the really large problems I was having with it but the drive is still useless. When it works it takes at least 150% longer to write to this stick than to (for example) my Lexar 2.0 stick (FAT32). Windows also seems to have trouble mounting the PNY, in that it takes an inordinately long time. All copy operations to the stick run in fits and starts, stalling out every few seconds so that you are waiting for the ""not responding"" error... but it eventually pulls through.I wouldn't trust this stick to put my laundry list on. I will continue to try to see what the problem is and get it working properly (and will update this review if I can get it working properly), but my hopes are slim. Normal reformatting, surface testing and chkdsk should be all one has to do to get a USB stick working. If this is due to exFAT, MS can keep it! And from now on I am sticking with Lexar which has always given me perfect performance.UPDATE: I decided to format it again since the exFAT formatting wasn't stable. This time I formatted to FAT32, but instead of doing a ""Quick Format"" I unchecked that box and let MS do it the long, slow, way to make sure it was formatted properly. It took over 2 hours but now the stick is more stable than it's ever been. So far anyway, Windows is mounting it quickly and files are staying put. It's behaving like any other stick. Now it's only drawback (pending any problems returning) is that it is a very slow stick.So if you haven't bought a stick yet, skip this one. If you have, you CAN reformat it but I would suggest doing the slow FAT32 format. And you might need to use EASEUS partition manager first to wipe the hidden partition."	1
679	Cheap batteries when you need backup power	Nothing spectacular here, these are typical Chinese made batteries. Your Canon 60D will not recognize the batteries as they are missing the original battery chip which is supplied by Canon inside the battery.Life is ok, but not as good as the original Canon batteries. Don't expect anything great from these. You get what you pay for, just a fall-back when you run out of juice.	0
680	Perfect for iPod Classic!	I purchased this remote for my iPod Classic. I've had the dock for it, but never had a remove and I figured since I have speakers and the extra iPod laying around, why not just buy the remote and put everything to good use! The remote works exactly how you'd hope, but like other reviewers have stated, the menu button doesn't work, but I'm not complaining because all I wanted was to be able to skip back and forward and adjust the volume and pause/play!Great product, fast shipping, best price. Enough said:)	0
681	buy the acase instead!	I bought this in August, and I just had to replace it. It took me three tries to put on my ipad which is unusual for me. (I usually get it in the first try.) It was so scratched up after two months that I had to replace it. Not a very good protector. Do yourself a favor, spend a little more and buy http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TRYENE/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00 the acase. It's worth it!	1

684	Has a mind of its own	"Well, it's been about a month since getting the laptop back from repair and the shut down problem has started all over, 3 times in the last two days. Customer service wants me to reset the laptop back to factory settings (yet once again) and if that doesn't fix the problem, send it in (yet once again). Also the keyboard back lighting has decided to not work and while working on the PC it will auto launch a random program??? I emailed corporate headquarters and asked for a refund/replacement, we'll see where that goes, but I'm done with resetting or sending this thing in for repair again, especially for the same problems. It's time to start saving for a different brand laptop, this one is being junked!This will be my last posting on this item. It went back for repair again for the same shutting down problem, plus no keyboard back lighting and a continual high CPU usage warning when running simple programs. It came back and I spent the morning loading up my programs, for some reason they reset the PC to factory standards and wiped out everything stored on the hard drive. While I was loading programs I noticed that the front power status LED's were not on, so, once again phoned support and, once again, was told that I would have to send it in again. In major frustration I phoned Amazon and explained what was going on with this PC and to my delight and surprise the offered to have it shipped back to them for a full refund. Thank you Amazon, that's why I continue doing business with you, your support and customer service attitude is at the very top of any company that I've had the pleasure to do business with.This isn't the best PC I've owned, not even close. It's slow to boot up, CPU usage is high, even with simple programs. The thing has shut down on me, estimated 10 times, since I purchased it, 1 month ago. This was while on AC with a fully charged battery installed. The only way to get it back on line is to do a boot. Customer service, although mostly nice, has no clue, I was told by one Tech that the sleep setting, set at 20 minutes, was the problem. Duh, it's not going to sleep, it's shutting down. But, to satisfy her I set it to ""never"" and it shut down twice within the next two hours. The next step is to send to to the factory, at my cost, for them to try and figure out what's wrong with the thing. Are there no decent PC's left on the market now? This wasn't bought for a workhorse, just a back up for my desk top. I am not satisfied, at all. I wouldn't recommend this PC to anyone.Asus finally decided that there was a problem with the laptop and asked me to send it in for review and repair. I received the laptop back after a month in repair. I phoned numerous times to try and get an update, but they would tell me nothing more than it was in repair. Only after asking for a supervisor did I get some answers. It was waiting for parts, but no one could tell me when the parts would arrive. They ended up having to replace the video card and the mother board. What they didn't tell me was that they hadn't installed the complete sound system at the factory and that was also addressed.Customer service for Asus is abysmal, the worst of any company that I have had the pleasure of doing business with and to top it off, there is no way of getting hold of a corporate Rep, as the machine is made and the company that makes it are outside of the USA and there is no contact available inside the USA."	1
685	Works great, but a couple minor issues.	All in all, this is a great, spacious, and affordable external HDD no matter what you need the space for.For Backup:I use the Seagate software to backup my machine and Windows backup for my wife's. Both work without a hitch. The Seagate software is a little awkward, but I used it to backup and restore after installation of a new internal hard drive and a fresh install of Windows 7 without any problem.For Extra Storage:I bring it over to a friend's house weekly to record gaming footage for our Youtube channel. There are no problems as far as storing large files and transferring them back and forth. It's easy to cart around and plug-n-play works flawlessly.The cons:I'm not comfortable with the stability of the unit itself. I know from experience that just a slight jostle from a fall while a hard drive is working can brick it. The Seagate drive is clearly meant to stand upright as it has no rubber feet on either face, and is glossy with rounded edges. Lying it down would result in the drive sliding around and becoming extremely scratched and dinged. I would have preferred a matte finish with rubber feet to lay it down flat.Also,the product description says you can buy a thunderbolt adapter for higher data transfer speeds. Unfortunately, all the manufacturer actually sells is a bulky, expensive adapter attachment, rather than a simple thunderbolt cable. I would have liked the option to purchase a cable for around $10 to quicken the transfer of my large video files.	1

693	It's exactly what you think it is.	My adage is: When it comes to ordering products, I rarely care about the name of the brand as long as I know it's good. My only exception is for electronic supplies, spa supplies and computer supplies. Don't screw around with your iPhone or iPad by trying to save a few dollars.  This product is the vein moving blood to your Apple product to keep it alive.  You wouldn't go to a third world doctor to keep you alive, so why would you do the same thing to your iPhone or iPad?  It's $19 and it's made correctly.  One crappy wire and it can kill your device.  There's a reason the Name Brand has 4 1/2 stars and the generic has 3 stars.  Do yourself a favor and protect your investment with the genuine product.	0
694	Samsung on the Top!	Super picture quality. Great contrast and color rendition. Like all LCDs generates some heat when on. Also, it has more reflections from rear windows  than I thought it would have.... a minor annoyance. Overall very satisfied with it and highly recommend the brand.	0
695	5 stars to Verbatim Customer Service for upholding their Warranty	I purchased this Verbatim 16 GB flash drive last year and wrote a number of files to it without a problem. Nearly a year went by before I used it again, but this time the computer would not recognize it. I plugged it into another computer, but it didn't recognize the flash drive either.I also purchased the 4 GB model which works just fine.WARRANTY:Since it was still under warranty, I decided to submit a claim via the Verbatim website.  I received an email reply one or two  working days later with directions to get the computer to recognize the flash drive. When that didn't work, Verbatim requested my contact information and the receipt.After customer service provided an RMA, I mailed the defective flash drive.  Soon after, I received a brand new flash drive in the mail... about two weeks in total duration from when I submitted the claim.This is only the second time I can recall returning a product under warranty and I am satisfied with the outcome. The process worked well, with no delays and no run-around. So 5 stars for Verbatim's customer service.RED FLASHING LIGHT:I also am pleasantly surprised that the new flash drive includes a red activity light. The original one didn't light up. I suspect this is a new feature since the 4 GB flash drive that is working doesn't light up either.PROS:- Verbatim lived up to their warranty with no fuss and no runaround.- The brand new replacement flash drive works just fine and has 4 years left on the warranty.- The new flash drive has a red indicator light.- It has a slider instead of a cap which can get misplaced.- The opening for a key chain is big enough.CONS:- I had to mail the defective drive back, but I'm satisfied that Verbatim made good on their warranty.TIP:- I don't always keep receipts and warranty information, but it's not such a bad idea, especially for bigger purchases.	1
696	Good product... requires some technical knowlege for setup.	"I bought the NSLU2 because it was a cheap and relatively easy way to use my existing external drives in an NAS configuration.  The first thing I did was update the firmware which was relatively straightforward though it did require me to use the much feared LINKSYS ""Erase All"" program.  However, I had no problems with the update and got the little NAS up and running relatively quickly.Since the NAS claims to support standard NFTS formatted USB drives, I just plugged in my drives which I'd been using with Windows XP.  This configuration was quite troublesome and the drives were constantly dropping data and requiring frequent re-booting.  After a little research I realized that I would be far better served reformatting the drives as EXT2.I backed up my data and used the NSLU2 to format the drives and then started again.  After doing this, I found the NSLU2's performance to be excellent.  It took me a number of hours to transfer about 200GB of data back on to my drives, but once complete, I found the SLUG to be more than capable of serving up my files to any of my three laptops around the house.Then I started playing with the FTP server and web access.  Adding users to the NSLU2 was straight forward but be aware that once you do this, you'll have to add each of your Window's users as NSLU2 users in order to access your mapped drives.  The FTP works well and the HTTP interface is excellent if you need to retrieve data while away from home.  I use a free DNS service to alleviate any problems associated with the Dynamic IP provided by my ISP.All said, after a few hours (days?) of tinkering, I'm very satisfied with my NSLU2 as a home based NAS that I occasionally access remotely.  My technical experience is moderate and I'm sure someone who is more experienced could do much more with this little NAS.  It gets four stars instead of five because it's a challenge to set up for someone with very little experience.  However, once it gets going, it will stream music or video, serve up files, and generally is a great home NAS."	0
