I got it yesterday @14,900 with SC 2K discount. Worth It.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Still I prefer to tell the major cons first:\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  1. Pathetic earpiece, ordinary as chinese mobile. Earlier Samsung use to give better earbuds but now they are doing cost cutting.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  2. Very small and inferior quality charging cable.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  3. Phone is not slim as well. Even, I afraid that on having back cover this will look more bulky.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  4. Front camera selfies are gud but not of 13MP quality.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  5. Phone mirroring and casting feature not provided.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  6. Battery stays last long for 12 hours max on normal usage.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  7. Installed Nougat 7.0 operating system has lot of bugs. So, sometimes your gmail contacts will be merged/swapped with each other in case u use more than one gmail account in the phone.

S-clean is a good feature introduced in this phone that helps deleting all junk files. So need not to install Clean master app.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  3. Finger print sensor and face recognition feature too gud to use.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  5. Cloning and multi screen are also good features wherein you can have 02 watsapp and can equally operate 02 apps at a time.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  6. Big 4GB RAM is more than enough to withhold the gaming thrust.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  7.

Yellow color is really not acceptable. Camera quality is not good not expect from 13MP samsung camera. The images capurtured by this phone is looks like low quality brands camera phones. M frequently mobiles changing person and the first thing i checked in mobiles are the camera quality. Do not buy this phone if u r a photography lover. Selfie 13MP camera looks like micromax 8MP camera. The images comes from its front camera are really very noisy and blurred. Choose something diffrent from samaung please go for moto g5plus. I request to flipkart to change the phone as it seems some quality in my phone, but they refused it. Now m lodge a case in consumer court against flipkart and the seller.
