I am giving my review after using it for 4 days almost 8-9 hrs daily and that is enough for me to judge as I have used 3 laptops before it.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Features:\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  With all proper drivers installed:\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  1.) Good clock speed and it really works fast. (2.5 GHz, turbo boost upto 3.1 GHz)\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  2.) Decent battery backup on moderate use (3.5 hrs on average from 100% to 15%)\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  3.) Works very good with windows 10 pro and all the features are well placed by lenovo on this machine.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Overall it's a very good product for business purpose and Data analysis task and some much heavier task too. With NVIDIA DDR5 dedicated graphics, you can easily play all recent games but do remember to play them on charging mode.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Cons:\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  1.) Only 2 USB 3.0 slot and no VGA output slot (HDMI only), the right side of laptop should have been utilized with at least one more USB 3.0 slot and VGA output slot.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  2.) Although sound is not bad but its pretty weak on the loudness part as compared to my previous Dell model with same Dolby audio feature.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  3.) and last, Flipkart must check with its Seller that why there is some issue in warranty status. I also got 10 days less warranty when I registered my device on Lenovo support centre.\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cspan class=\"_2jRR3v\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan\u003e\n   READ MORE\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/span\u003e"}

But it does the work if a charging point Is at a decent distance\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Processor- i5 7th gen\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Graphics-2 Giga Byte Nvidia Geforce 940mx + intel HD  620 Graphics\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Ram- 8 Giga Bytes DDR4 (but distributed in both slots 4GB each)\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Powered by a 2 cell battery which lasted about 3 Hours 30 Min on first charge, So i believe Battery won't last that long in this laptop.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  There's minor heat up near the mouse track pad while charging or slight heavy usage. Haven't installed games yet, But expect a little heating while Gaming too.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Its not a Led Back lit Keyboard, but wide enough and quite comfortable to use.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  The Mouse track pad does not support Multi Touch and is not that comfortable to use(may vary for different users) but it does the work quite smoothly.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  The screen is not a Full HD screen, But its decent indoors and the viewing angles are Fine too. But Don't expect a lot from the screen.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Speaker placement is at the bottom of the laptop, And is said to be a Dolby Speakers. Yet the sound is not loud enough. But the quality of the sound is crisp and clear and would do the work for you if you  are a earphone/headphone person.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  I would be updating the review after a short amount of time and using this laptop as a regular choice of mine. Meanwhile ask any queries that you might have before the purchase.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Also do checkout the 8th gen laptops that have started launching and if you can wait for a while, Better switch to a 8th gen laptop.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  But if the 8th gen does not peak your interest and you want reliable laptop. go ahead and give this laptop a try.\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cspan class=\"_2jRR3v\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan\u003e\n   READ MORE\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/span\u003e"}

But one thing you have to keep in mind is that the intel core i5 7002u is a Kaby Lake processor and that  is why the laptop will only support windows 10 64-bit (UEFI boot mode recommended). otherwise you will face many other problems that you won't be able to notice the cause of.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  *I chose this laptop because of it's ground breaking specifications and Nvidea GeForce 940mx which really Is a powerful processor (I have played watch dogs 2 and GTA V at good graphic settings without noticing any leg or frame drops)\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  *sound output is good although dolby option in settings is a plus point for some peoples but I don't like that option that much(frankly speaking).\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  *screen is pretty descent enough and also colour reproduction, Brightness, \u0026amp; saturation  is good too.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  SOME THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS MACHINE:-\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  *only two USB ports are provided but the good thing is both are 3.0\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  *battery backup is a bit lower according to my liking Lenovo should have provided a bigger battery because it has to handle a powerful GPU too.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  *cooling fan is on the bottom of this laptop and that is why you have to use the laptop on a flat surface and you will not be able to use the laptop while putting it in bad or any kind of spongy surface which can mask the fan for a very long time. But don't bother about that because most of the laptops are coming with the same fitting of fan and that is why it's not a big issue.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  QUESTIONS I AM PRETTY EXCITED TO ANSWER:-\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  *some peoples are saying that the mousepad is not working out of the box and cursor is not moving?\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  well I have already told you that it is a kaby lake processor and will only accept win 10 64- bit and boot in UEFI mode you will not face this kind of issue for sure and if you does than time to replace your product because it is definitely a faulty one.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  *Laptop is making noise like kurrrrrr?\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Mine is not, so I will not say anything about this issue.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Friends, the thing is you simply install win 10 64-bit and you will not face any issues, Or if you don't wanna go through all the pain than simply buy the windows variant of this laptop which is available at the price of 45,990/- and if you have 4000 bucks extra to spend than you should definitely buy the windows variant.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Thank you for reading my opinion and also for reading it till the last..\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cspan class=\"_2jRR3v\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan\u003e\n   READ MORE\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/span\u003e"}

I have been using it for past 1 month and my review and ratings are based on the my usage( which is quite heavy). Lenovo could have provided Back-lit keyboard since it's completely unusable at night. Talking about the performance, I'm completely happy with my purchase as it sufficient to handle every heavy support and games. Speakers isn't that loud though.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  I have been using Adobe Primere Pro and Photoshop without any lag. But I still can't figure out the disk usage soaring to 100% if multiple software like this opened in the background. This never happens with my desktop with Rygen 3 processor Radeon RX560 and 8 GB of RAMs. Well it's not that big issue since I'm not going to use these type of heavy apps everyday and simultaneously. When I purchased it I'm little bit confused of it's dedicated GPU performance i.e GeForce 940MX. I have to reduce the settings to med-low in some of the recent titles. I'll tell you some of the major games which can be played at above 30-35fps\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Call of duty series\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Battlefield series. You'll have to reduce the settings to low for the upcoming battlefield 1\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Far cry series\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Fallout series\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Need for speed series\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Forza series\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Splinter cell series\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Batman Arkham series\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Crysis series\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  GTA series\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  It can run many games. Personally, I think that most graphically demanding games up to late 2015 can be run by it at reasonable settings. From late 2015 it may run some games mostly at med-low or low settings, but not all - and may pretty much struggle when running these that it can.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Keyboard in this laptop is top notch, but I'm little bit disappointed with trackpad it's not that responsive.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Battery life in this device is quite good(not the best I would say since I have a surface 4 with me that has a magnificent battery life). It can deliver 4-5 hours of battery life but if you work with battery saver on then it can go past 7 hrs mark easily.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Overall a recommended product.\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cspan class=\"_2jRR3v\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan\u003e\n   READ MORE\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/span\u003e"}

I have ordered this on 9th Sept and received the product on 10th Sept. Really super quick delivery from Flipkart. I won't discuss about the configuration and hardware as it is already mentioned in the specifications of the product. So now, let's go into my first impressions of the product.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  The overall look of the product is nice. It feels nice on the top with smooth black finish and lenovo branding on it. The keyboard is Alphanumeric, but the only bummer is that the   and   arrow keys are integrated into one key's space. The mouse keys are integrated into the touchpad because of which the touchpad doesn't feel like it is sturdy enough. There are no air vents on the sides. They are located just below the screen near the link between the lower and upper parts of laptop and the other under the laptop. I have installed dual OS, Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.0.4. But I didn't feel any heat dissipating from the laptop while installation. Everyone is raising concerns about sound output from speakers and some sound coming out from hard drive. But I don't have faced any such issues. There is no sound coming from my hard drive. The sound output is not very less and also not too high. It is moderate and audible enough if you keep your laptop on flat surface and not on bed. One interesting feature is that the screen opens up upto 180 , a feature that none of it's competitors have. The battery is non-removable and battery life is nearly 4-5 hrs with wifi turned on and moderate internet usage.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  So overall, the product is decent enough and really a bang for your buck. If you are in market looking for a laptop with decent looks and good performance I would definitely recommend this. I will update about the pros and cons of the product once I test it for 3-4 weeks.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Please do like if you loved my first impressions on the product and wait till my next update with my comprehensive review about the product.\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cspan class=\"_2jRR3v\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan\u003e\n   READ MORE\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/span\u003e"}

Finally bought it. It got delivered in 2 days.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  I bought the win10 model at 45k. There are no sounds in the HDD as pointed out by some. My only advice is,buy the win10 model,because on Linux or Kali or Ubuntu,the touchpad will not work at all. Plus,all the driver softwares are meant for win10 only.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  It has a 4gb Intel Graphics 620 integrated graphics card. I was surprised to see this,as it has not been mentioned anywhere. The 2gb ultra fast NV card is there too,which makes a total of 6gb graphics.

Purchased this laptop on sale and got it for 38k with Windows 10 pre-installed, which is a pretty good deal. After playing with a week writing this review. This is the best buy for school/college related works and little gaming. I'm not a big fan of high end games so can't comment seriously about the graphic processor's performance. But considering Nvidia 940mx 2GB DDR5, i hope its capable enough to play games with low to medium settings. Regarding the processor, yes its i5-7200U which is a kabylake segment and I could able to see its turbo boosting to 3.1GHz quite often but the 5400RPM 1TB HDD is quite slow to load some programs. But considering the price we can't expect more than this. It has 8GB of RAM and while checking in Task Manager seems both the slots are occupied and I'm assuming its 2x4GB are there. Windows start up is quite fast for this segment. All drivers are preinstalled already and comes with 1 year Mcafee live safe preinstalled. One point to mention here is whole 1TB is dedicated to C drive. Regarding charger, Yes its quite handy, but length of the wire is not too long but manageable, It charges quite fast like in 2 hrs and battery backup when doing light work you can expect upto 3.30 to 4 hrs and with battery saving turned on, it should be above 4 to 5 hrs. Lenovo website is quite handy for updating the drivers, Let the laptop auto detect itself on their site and you will get notification for Driver updates. Yesterday I received BIOS update and I really like the way its designed. You won't be receiving any DVD/CD along with the package but you can get the recovery media from the Lenovo site by placing the order since this particular variant is eligible to get one. Please note, you can order ONLY ONCE and you should keep your recovery media USB safe. After ordering, you get a link from where you have to download Lenovo recovery tool which validates your order and automatically downloads the required recovery media and it'll let you copy the same in USB(16GB recommended). I liked this recovery media support from Lenovo and I give thumps up for this. Coming to the audio performance, its not that loud but audio is crisp and clear. I recommend using Head phones. Webcam is good for this price.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Why I bought this laptop?\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  1. Needed i5 7th Gen within 40k range\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  2. In future replacing the internal HDD with SSD one will increase the performance like 60 to 70%\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  3. Since 2 slots are there, RAM is upgradable to 16GB in future if needed..Yes DDR4 indeed\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Please note: There is a little noise from HDD but its not such a big issue since mechanical parts are involved, even my old laptop gave me similar noise. When the deal is good for future you can compromise here and there.\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cspan class=\"_2jRR3v\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan\u003e\n   READ MORE\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/span\u003e"}

Just amazing. If you are wondering if it looks like the one shown in the picture, you are in for a surprise. It looks much better. US layout keyboard is unique, nothing like you might have bought before. Sleek and light. Pretty amazing configuration in the given price. Not sure how to get that offer of extended warranty from Lenovo, which has been a bummer. But the product quality and esthetics are top notch. Highly recommended as your first laptop. If however, you wanted to go for some better performance laptop with more features, the only thing you can try which, in my opinion, is better than this would be a touch enabled laptop in the range of 60000 to 90000. But within the range of 50000,this is an absolute killer.\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cspan class=\"_2jRR3v\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan\u003e\n   READ MORE\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/span\u003e"}

Once you remove some of the bloatware, this is easily the best piece of hardware this side of the 40K mark. A 7th Gen i5, with 8GB RAM is unheard of in this segment. The screen is not Full HD, so that can be a bummer, but it's doable for the price you pay - especially since it comes with a 2GB Nvidia Graphic Card which should be good enough for most games on low settings. The build quality is also pretty decent for the price, and even though there is a little flex when you press down hard on the keyboard section, it feels sturdy enough as a whole. Again - this is no unibody Aluminum build - so expecting that kind of quality at this rate is unrealistic.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Overall, a build totally worth it.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  P.S. - Make sure you check the warranty date, cause mine was already active a month before I got delivery (only got 11 months remaining on warranty) - so I had to contact Lenovo Customer Support.

Core i5 7th gen is insanely fast and coupled with ddr4 8gb ram and ddr5 nvidia 940mx makes it one of the best laptops under 50k. This kind of deal under 36k is unbelievable and i thanks flipkart for the big billion sale for that. It also has dolby audio and watching movies or listening to songs is a theatre like experience. It can easily run any latest games in medium/high config . I have tested battlefield 1 mafia 3 and Pes 2018 in it and they all run buttery smooth with medium graphics.\n  \u003cbr/\u003e\n  Overall its just a must buy if u are a casual gamer like me looking for a lappy under 40 or even 50k.
