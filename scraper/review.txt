Best product in 8k range.. M using this phone form last 5 days did not get any issue.. Better than moto and lenovo (Chinese cheap) products. Cam is also very good as in some reviews it was mentioned no so. No heating issues, no hang problem... Specially look and touch screen is very smooth and sensitive.... Can go for it if budget is under 8000rs.

Review Title : Unsatisfactory

Review Content :
Don't buy this phone. Checkout the reasons below:
  <br/>
  1. This phone is an old model launched in June 2016 in CHINA (Google it)
  <br/>
  2. Resolution of this phone is below the standard  (inferior to Samsung On5)
  <br/>
  3. Android 5.1 is given with this phone that makes it more pathetic and irritating.
  <br/>
  4. Even after having better configuration, it runs slow.
  <br/>
  5. Camera quality is just like 2G or 3G phone.

Product is very good at the present price, if OS Marshmallow is given with this mobile, that would be an added advantage. They gave only Lollipop version. For alarm, the volume is very low.
  <br/>
  Phone is slim and easy to use, all other features are good as usual.
